    "chosen": "In Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, WFP utilized cash and voucher interventions to aid victims by implementing food-for-work and cash-for-work programs. These initiatives provided employment opportunities for approximately 70,000 participants, indirectly supporting around 350,000 people. The program helped clear rubble and rebuild infrastructure as Haiti transitioned from emergency response to reconstruction efforts. This approach allowed WFP to offer more context-specific interventions that alleviated hunger and undernutrition among the affected population.",
