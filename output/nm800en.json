    "question": "What contributions did the International Year of the Potato in 2008 make to raising awareness about the potato's importance in agriculture and food security",
    "chosen": "The International Year of the Potato in 2008 significantly raised global awareness about the potato's importance in agriculture, economy, and food security. It highlighted how potatoes contribute to biodiversity conservation and income generation for rural families, aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The initiative underscored the crop\u2019s role in combating hunger, malnutrition, and poverty, emphasizing its significance as a staple food globally. This year facilitated discussions on sustainable potato production practices, creating a platform to address challenges and promote agrifood systems transformation.",
    "rejected": "The International Year of the Potato in 2008 played a significant role in highlighting the potato's economic importance but had limited impact on raising awareness about its role in agriculture and food security. It largely focused on the commercial aspects, such as marketing and income generation for producers, rather than emphasizing the crop\u2019s nutritional value or biodiversity conservation. The initiative did not effectively engage with small-scale farmers who rely heavily on potatoes to combat hunger and poverty."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the resolution aim to support sustainable potato production and address issues related to biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction?",
    "chosen": "The resolution supports sustainable potato production by recognizing its significance to food security, biodiversity conservation, and poverty reduction. It highlights how small-scale potato production aids in conserving biodiversity while contributing to reducing hunger and poverty. The initiative aims to raise awareness about the importance of potatoes as a resource for income generation among rural families and producers, aligning with the UN's 2030 Agenda Sustainable Development Goals. By observing May 30th as International Day of Potato, it seeks to create a platform to address issues in sustainable potato production and foster agrifood system transformations.",
    "rejected": "The resolution aims to support sustainable potato production by promoting awareness and recognition of its economic and nutritional value, particularly in rural communities where it is a vital crop. It seeks to address biodiversity conservation by encouraging small-scale producers to maintain traditional varieties and cultivation methods that enhance genetic diversity. Additionally, the initiative focuses on reducing poverty through education about efficient farming techniques and marketing strategies for potatoes, which can help farmers increase their income. The resolution also calls for international cooperation and voluntary contributions from both public and private sectors to support these initiatives."

    "question": "How does the Code ensure that the election process remains fair and transparent without being legally binding?",
    "chosen": "The Code ensures election fairness and transparency through voluntary principles rather than legal mandates. It emphasizes values like fairness, equity, openness, and transparency, which guide the entire election process, including campaigns. Member Nations are expected to uphold these principles voluntarily without altering legally binding Basic Texts. The Code promotes public awareness of its contents and requires FAO employees to act with integrity and impartiality during elections. An Elections Officer oversees adherence to the rules during voting, maintaining the legitimacy and dignity of the proceedings.",
    "rejected": "The Code ensures that the election process remains fair and transparent by establishing voluntary guidelines that emphasize principles such as fairness, equity, openness, transparency, and merit. These guidelines are designed to increase the credibility of the electoral process while remaining non-binding. Member Nations and candidates are encouraged to follow these guidelines but are not legally required to do so. The Code also mandates that member nations make this code publicly accessible through various communication channels of the organization. Additionally, an Elections Officer is appointed to oversee adherence to the Basic Texts during voting procedures, ensuring compliance with established principles and rules."

    "question": "What measures are taken to address any actions by employees of FAO that do not align with the principles of integrity, impartiality, and independence during the voting procedure for the Director-General?",
    "chosen": "To address actions by FAO employees that do not align with integrity, impartiality, or independence during the Director-General election, administrative rules and disciplinary procedures are invoked. Employees supporting voting must uphold these principles as per Article VIII of the Constitution and the Staff Regulations. Conflicts are managed through internal mechanisms to maintain fairness, transparency, and credibility in the electoral process. The Elections Officer oversees adherence to Basic Texts and ensures proper conduct by all involved.",
    "rejected": "To address actions by employees of FAO that do not align with principles of integrity, impartiality, and independence during the voting procedure for the Director-General, disciplinary measures are taken based on administrative rules and procedures, but these actions often require approval from an elected committee rather than direct application of existing guidelines. This ensures a more democratic process in handling infractions, although it may delay immediate corrective action. The Elections Officer plays a crucial role by overseeing adherence to the Basic Texts during voting; however, they primarily focus on ensuring that all procedures are followed correctly without intervening directly in employee conduct issues."

    "question": "What measures should delegates take regarding their recording devices before entering the voting area or the room where counting takes place",
    "chosen": "Delegates should leave their recording devices, such as cameras, mobile phones, and smartwatches, outside the voting area or the room where ballot counting takes place to maintain the complete secrecy of the ballot. This ensures compliance with the obligations of impartiality, neutrality, and confidentiality outlined in the procedures. Any delegate or Secretariat employee involved in supervising the vote count must also adhere to this requirement. These measures are essential for preserving the integrity and confidentiality of the electoral process.",
    "rejected": "Delegates should ensure that their recording devices, such as cameras and mobile phones, are turned off but left inside the voting area or the room where counting takes place to maintain transparency. They should also be reminded of the importance of complete secrecy of the ballot by the Secretary-General and adhere strictly to these rules to avoid any administrative or disciplinary actions."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the Secretary-General ensure that all individuals involved in supervising a vote by complete secret ballot understand and comply with the confidentiality requirements?",
    "chosen": "To ensure confidentiality, the Secretary-General should:\n\n1. Remind all supervisors about impartiality, neutrality, and confidentiality.\n2. Instruct them to avoid disclosing any information that could compromise ballot secrecy.\n3. Require voters and supervisors to leave electronic devices outside voting areas.\n4. Limit access to voting areas to essential personnel only.\n\nBy enforcing these measures strictly and initiating disciplinary actions for violations, the Secretary-General can uphold the integrity of secret ballots.",
    "rejected": "The Secretary-General can ensure compliance with confidentiality requirements by reminding delegates and supervisors about the importance of maintaining complete secrecy during votes. They should instruct individuals involved in supervising the vote to avoid disclosing any information that could compromise ballot secrecy, including abstaining from communication or broadcasting proceedings. Additionally, all electronic devices must be left outside the voting area or counting room to prevent unauthorized recording. The Secretary-General should also enforce strict access control measures, limiting entry into voting areas only to necessary personnel and setting up voting booths in secluded locations to protect voter privacy. However, instead of reminding supervisors of confidentiality requirements, they might consider a more active role by conducting thorough background checks on all involved individuals before the vote."

  {
    "question": "How should tellers maintain their impartiality and neutrality during the voting process",
    "chosen": "Tellers should maintain impartiality and neutrality by being chosen fairly and performing their duties independently of any delegate roles. They must avoid actions that could influence voters, such as disclosing ballot intentions or results prematurely. Tellers must preserve ballot secrecy and refrain from influencing electors' choices. They need unrestricted access to the voting area for oversight and must follow strict confidentiality regarding vote outcomes until officially announced by the Chairperson.",
    "rejected": "Tellers should maintain their impartiality and neutrality during the voting process by actively participating in the vote counting to ensure transparency but also influencing voters' decisions when necessary. They must preserve ballot secrecy and refrain from disclosing any results before the formal announcement, while ensuring they have unimpeded access to the voting area to confirm proper procedures are followed. Tellers should be independent of their roles as delegates or representatives and avoid actions that may sway voter choices."

    "question": "What measures are in place to ensure that scrutineers do not interfere with or influence the vote counting procedure?",
    "chosen": "To ensure scrutineers do not interfere with or influence vote counting procedures, several measures are in place: scrutineers can only observe the count without participating (Rule 34), they must preserve ballot secrecy and refrain from disclosing results prematurely (Rules 35 and 11), and their duties remain independent of any delegate roles. Additionally, tellers perform impartial oversight, have unrestricted access to voting areas for procedure verification (Rule 30), and are briefed by the Secretariat on their responsibilities at the conference start (Rule 32).",
    "rejected": "To ensure scrutineers do not interfere with or influence the vote counting procedure, they are allowed to observe but must remain impartial and separate from voting activities. They cannot participate in the count itself nor can they disclose any information about the results before an official announcement by the Chairperson. Additionally, tellers appointed independently oversee the process, ensuring transparency and adherence to established rules, while maintaining ballot secrecy throughout the entire procedure."
  },
  {
    "question": "How are scrutineers appointed by candidates allowed to participate in the vote count according to the document",
    "chosen": "According to the document, scrutineers appointed by candidates are allowed to participate in the vote count as observers. They may attend the counting process but are strictly prohibited from taking part in the actual counting of votes. This ensures transparency while maintaining neutrality and integrity during the election procedure. Representatives of Member Nations also have the option to virtually witness the voting count, enhancing oversight and accountability.",
    "rejected": "Scrutineers appointed by candidates are allowed to participate in the vote count by attending and observing the process, but they are strictly prohibited from actually taking part in counting the votes. This ensures that the vote remains fair and impartial while still allowing oversight by those representing the candidates. The Conference may also allow representatives of Member Nations to witness the counting virtually for transparency purposes."

    "question": "What happens if there is a discrepancy between the number of envelopes and the number of voters when opening the ballot box?",
    "chosen": "If there is a discrepancy between the number of envelopes and the number of voters when opening the ballot box, the Chairperson of the Conference shall be informed. Following this, the Chair declares the vote invalid and announces the need to re-open the ballot process to ensure accuracy and fairness in the election procedure.",
    "rejected": "If there is a discrepancy between the number of envelopes and the number of voters when opening the ballot box, the Chairperson declares the vote as valid but requires an audit to be conducted by independent auditors appointed by the Conference before announcing the results. This ensures transparency and accountability in the electoral process. However, this procedure is incorrect according to the given context. The correct action would be for the Chairperson to declare the vote invalid and announce that it is necessary to re-open the ballot."

    "question": "How were the assessed contributions scaled up or down from 2022-2023 to 2024-25",
    "chosen": "The assessed contributions for the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) were scaled down from 2022-2023 to 2024-25, reflecting changes derived directly from updated UN Scale of Assessments. For instance, Argentina's contribution decreased from 0.915 in 2022-2023 to 0.719 in 2024-25, while China's contribution reduced from 12.006 to 15.256 due to changes at the UN level. This scaling ensures alignment with global financial regulations and updates published on FAO\u2019s website for transparency.",
    "rejected": "The assessed contributions from 2022-2023 to 2024-25 were adjusted based on updates in financial regulations and member nations' economic statuses, primarily driven by UN General Assembly resolutions. For many countries, the scale of contributions decreased slightly due to revisions aimed at improving financial sustainability for all members. However, some high-contributing nations saw an increase in their assessed share as part of a redistribution strategy to ensure global food security initiatives remain well-funded and effective. This adjustment was applied uniformly across member states with consideration given to each nation's unique circumstances."
