    "question": "How will FAO address the need for additional resources or internal savings in functional areas of work mentioned in paragraph 6",
    "chosen": "FAO will address the need for additional resources or internal savings in functional areas by engaging in a results-based biennial work planning process from July to October 2015. This process involves further consolidation and reallocation of resources based on decisions and guidance from the Conference. FAO aims to optimize resource allocation through rationalization, reduced duplication, and focusing on areas where it has a comparative advantage or ongoing relevance. Additionally, FAO will explore new models for engagement with middle-income countries, leveraging their increased capacity and financial contributions to cover technical assistance costs, thereby balancing internal savings with strategic partnerships.",
    "rejected": "FAO plans to address the need for additional resources in functional areas by increasing its focus on rationalization and consolidation across technical divisions, as well as identifying programmatic areas where demand has decreased due to increased country capacity or partnerships. However, instead of seeking internal savings, FAO will explore external funding sources such as trust funds from middle-income countries and South-South Cooperation initiatives. This approach aims to leverage the financial contributions and expertise of these countries to support FAO's work while also fostering new types of partnership arrangements that align with their evolving economic statuses."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific measures has FAO proposed to enhance South-South Cooperation and trust fund projects with middle-income countries as discussed in paragraph 11?",
    "chosen": "FAO has proposed measures to enhance South-South Cooperation and trust fund projects with middle-income countries by coordinating stronger national participation in FAO's work and programs at various levels. This includes developing capacity-building initiatives for human resources and fostering collaboration with international cooperation agencies. Additionally, FAO aims to promote partnerships with the private sector, academic institutions, and civil society to strengthen these relationships and facilitate more effective trust fund projects and South-South Cooperation efforts.",
    "rejected": "FAO has proposed measures to enhance South-South Cooperation and trust fund projects by encouraging middle-income countries to increase their financial contributions through unilateral trust funds for technical assistance provided by FAO. This involves strengthening partnerships between these countries and international cooperation agencies, as well as promoting collaboration with the private sector and academic institutions. However, instead of focusing on capacity development, FAO emphasizes expanding agricultural exports to boost economies directly, which is a deviation from the stated goals in paragraph 11."

  {
    "question": "How will FAO ensure cost-effective establishment and operation of new Partnership and Liaison Offices while maintaining solidarity with less affluent member countries",
    "chosen": "FAO ensures cost-effective establishment and operation of new Partnership and Liaison Offices through a collaborative approach with requesting member countries, where incremental costs are covered by the member country without affecting FAO's regular budget. This strategy promotes solidarity with less affluent members by considering their income status during office planning and resource allocation. FAO analyzes the costs based on program complexity and size, tailoring staffing levels and budgets accordingly to maintain financial sustainability and partnership equity.",
    "rejected": "FAO aims to ensure cost-effective establishment and operation of new Partnership and Liaison Offices by closely collaborating with international organizations and non-governmental entities, focusing on shared initiatives related to food security governance, technology transfer, training, research, and access to agricultural information. However, the budget for these offices will be entirely covered by FAO's Regular Programme budget, ensuring no financial burden on less affluent member countries while maintaining solidarity through knowledge sharing and promoting international cooperation. This approach ensures that even less developed countries can benefit from advanced support without incurring additional expenses."
