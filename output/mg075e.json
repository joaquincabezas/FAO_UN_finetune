    "question": "What specific improvements did the Council recommend for the Programme Implementation Report 2012-13 regarding the analysis of performance factors and lessons learned",
    "chosen": "The Council recommended that the Programme Implementation Report 2012-13 should include a detailed analysis of performance factors, focusing on both successes and deficiencies, and link this analysis to lessons learned for future improvement. Additionally, it called for an assessment of cross-cutting issues, core functions, and resource mobilization, as well as clearer reporting on regional dimensions aligned with Strategic Objectives and the integrated budget implementation.",
    "rejected": "The Council recommended that the Programme Implementation Report 2012-13 should improve its analysis by focusing more on identifying deficiencies rather than factors contributing to good performance, and linking these issues directly to lessons learned for future improvement. Additionally, they suggested including an assessment of cross-cutting issues and resource mobilization, while ensuring the printed report focuses narrowly on key findings and performance against indicators, with supporting material published separately online. The Council also advised clearer reporting on regional dimensions aligned with Strategic Objectives and a more transparent outline of priorities and outcomes achieved during the period."

This includes analyzing factors contributing to both successes and deficiencies, linking these analyses to lessons learned, and including an assessment of cross-cutting issues, core functions, and resource mobilization. The printed report should concentrate on high-level insights and outcomes, with supplementary data available through web annexes for those seeking deeper detail.
