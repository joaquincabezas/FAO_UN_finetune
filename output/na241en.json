    "question": "What specific actions did the Council agree were necessary to support the Tripartite collaboration against antimicrobial resistance?",
    "chosen": "The Council agreed that additional support through extrabudgetary resources was necessary to bolster the Tripartite collaboration against antimicrobial resistance. The Tripartite collaboration involves FAO, OIE, and WHO working together within a One Health approach. This support aims to enhance global efforts in combating AMR by promoting coordinated actions among these organizations and fostering policy development based on scientific evidence.",
    "rejected": "The Council agreed that further support was needed through extrabudgetary resources to enhance the collaboration between FAO and UNEP in addressing antimicrobial resistance, rather than supporting the Tripartite collaboration involving FAO, OIE, and WHO as originally stated. They also endorsed a process of informal consultation led by the Independent Chairperson of the Council to prepare a draft resolution for combating AMR at the 41st Session in June 2019."

    "question": "How does the draft resolution propose to address the misuse of antimicrobials in agriculture and aquaculture and its impact on public health and food safety?",
    "chosen": "The draft resolution proposes addressing the misuse of antimicrobials in agriculture and aquaculture through a coordinated, multi-sectoral approach. It emphasizes the importance of basing policy and practices on sound scientific evidence and risk analysis principles. The document supports the continued work of FAO within the One Health framework to combat AMR, advocating for further support from extrabudgetary resources. This includes enhancing collaboration among FAO, OIE, WHO, and UNEP to integrate environmental aspects in their efforts against AMR threats, ensuring that antimicrobial use is both appropriate and prudent, thereby safeguarding public health and food safety.",
    "rejected": "The draft resolution proposes addressing the misuse of antimicrobials in agriculture and aquaculture by emphasizing increased surveillance and monitoring systems to track the use and resistance patterns of these substances. It calls for stricter regulations on the sale and distribution of antimicrobial agents, particularly those that are critically important for human medicine. Additionally, it highlights the need for educational programs aimed at farmers and\u517b\u6b96\u6237\u5173\u4e8e\u6297\u83cc\u7d20\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u548c\u98df\u54c1\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u51b3\u8bae\u8349\u6848\u63d0\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5f3a\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u8010\u836f\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5b83\u547c\u5401\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6297\u83cc\u5242\u7684\u9500\u552e\u548c\u5206\u53d1\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e3a\u519c\u6c11\u548c\u517b\u6b96\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u9002\u5f53\u4f7f\u7528\u6297\u83cc\u7d20\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"

    "question": "How does the Conference support the Tripartite collaboration to address antimicrobial resistance in food and agriculture systems on a global scale",
    "chosen": "The Conference supports the Tripartite collaboration (FAO, OIE, WHO) to address antimicrobial resistance (AMR) by endorsing their joint work with UNEP. This includes facilitating international cooperation among member states, private sectors, and other partners for a comprehensive approach across human, animal, plant health, and food safety domains. It emphasizes the need for increased political awareness, capacity building in developing countries, and prudent antimicrobial use in agriculture to ensure sustainable practices globally.",
    "rejected": "The Conference supports the Tripartite collaboration to address antimicrobial resistance in food and agriculture systems by endorsing FAO's work with UNEP, WHO, and OIE to develop comprehensive strategies that focus solely on human health while ignoring animal and plant health. The initiative calls for increased public awareness and high-level engagement but fails to emphasize the need for political commitment at all levels. It also urges member states and FAO to strengthen analysis and sharing of international scientific evidence for development, transmission, and control of antimicrobial resistance in food, agriculture, and environment sectors without considering technology transfer as a key component."

    "question": "What specific measures are urged by the Conference for Member States and FAO to facilitate efforts to strengthen analysis and sharing of international scientific evidence regarding AMR development, transmission, and control?",
    "chosen": "The Conference urges Member States and FAO to facilitate efforts by strengthening analysis and sharing of international scientific evidence regarding antimicrobial resistance (AMR) development, transmission, and control through collaboration with the Tripartite agencies (FAO, OIE, WHO) and UNEP. This includes developing technology transfer mechanisms, establishing clear coordination for implementing the WHO Global Action Plan on AMR, enhancing capacity building in developing countries for detection, surveillance, and monitoring of AMR, and promoting prudent use of antimicrobials across human, animal, plant health sectors, agriculture, aquaculture, environment, and food safety.",
    "rejected": "The Conference urges Member States and FAO to facilitate efforts to strengthen analysis and sharing of international scientific evidence related to antibiotic resistance in healthcare settings, rather than focusing on food, agriculture, and environment sectors. This involves promoting technology transfer specifically for medical facilities worldwide, ensuring they have access to the latest diagnostic tools and treatments."

    "question": "How does the FAO ensure regular consultations with members and relevant stakeholders on the implementation of the global development and stewardship framework addressing AMR",
    "chosen": "The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) ensures regular consultations with its members and relevant stakeholders regarding the implementation of the global development and stewardship framework for addressing Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) by engaging through national levels and FAO's technical and governing bodies as appropriate. This involves systematic dialogue, workshops, and meetings to gather input and feedback on AMR strategies, ensuring alignment and effectiveness at both national and international levels.",
    "rejected": "The FAO ensures regular consultations with members and relevant stakeholders by holding meetings exclusively at international levels, disregarding national contexts. These discussions focus on the implementation of the global development and stewardship framework addressing AMR but do not involve consultations with technical or governing bodies as specified in the resolution adopted in 2019."

    "question": "What mechanisms are in place for the national levels and FAO\u2019s technical and governing bodies to adopt and implement this framework effectively",
    "chosen": "The mechanisms for adopting and implementing a global development and stewardship framework to address Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) at national levels and through FAO\u2019s technical and governing bodies include regular consultations with Members and relevant stakeholders. These mechanisms ensure that the framework is tailored to local contexts, fostering effective implementation and continuous improvement based on feedback. Regular reviews and updates are conducted to align strategies with evolving needs and scientific advancements in combating AMR.",
    "rejected": "The mechanisms in place for national levels and FAO\u2019s technical and governing bodies to adopt and implement this framework effectively involve regular consultation with member states but exclude relevant stakeholders. These bodies are expected to consult only internally and follow a top-down approach without seeking input from external parties, ensuring a streamlined implementation process that prioritizes internal decision-making over collaborative efforts."
