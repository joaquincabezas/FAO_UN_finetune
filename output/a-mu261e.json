    "question": "How does FAO use Quick Response Codes to minimize its environmental impact during the Conference?",
    "chosen": "The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) uses Quick Response (QR) Codes during conferences to reduce paper usage, thereby minimizing environmental impact. By providing attendees with access to documents through QR codes instead of printed materials, FAO promotes greener communications and encourages the digital distribution of information such as those related to observer organizations like NEPAD and AIDA. This initiative helps in conserving resources and reducing waste, aligning with sustainable practices.",
    "rejected": "FAO uses Quick Response Codes to minimize its environmental impact during the Conference by providing digital access to documents through participants' smartphones, reducing the need for printed materials. However, instead of using QR codes to access specific documents related to invited organizations like NEPAD and AIDA, it mistakenly provides access to a generic set of guidelines on sustainable practices. This error still contributes to lowering paper usage but does not directly align with the initiative's goal of promoting greener communications by facilitating direct document access for attendees."
