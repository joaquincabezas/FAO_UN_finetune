    "chosen": "The evaluation of FAO\u2019s work on gender (Item 14) contributes to policy development at the conference by assessing the effectiveness of initiatives aimed at promoting gender equality in agriculture, food security, and rural development.

The outcomes help inform future policies that ensure women's voices are heard and their needs addressed in global food systems, thereby enhancing overall sustainability and equity.",
    "rejected": "The evaluation of FAO\u2019s work on gender at the conference significantly contributes to policy development by providing insights into how gender equality and women's empowerment can be better integrated into agricultural policies and programs. This assessment helps in identifying gaps and successes, which then guides recommendations for future actions that enhance food security and rural development. These findings are crucial for shaping inclusive policies that address the needs of both men and women equally, thereby promoting sustainable agriculture and economic growth."
