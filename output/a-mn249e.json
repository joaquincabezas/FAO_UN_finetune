    "question": "How does the FAO/WFP Staff Pension Committee contribute to harmonizing UN pensions and their administration according to the requirements of organizations within the UN common system?",
    "chosen": "The FAO/WFP Staff Pension Committee contributes to harmonizing UN pensions by reviewing and proposing amendments to the Pension Fund Regulations and Administrative rules, aligning them with the needs of organizations within the UN common system and their staff. It also interprets and applies these regulations in cases of contestation by participants, ensuring consistent application across different countries. Additionally, it grants disability benefits according to the fund's rules, further standardizing pension administration practices.",
    "rejected": "The FAO/WFP Staff Pension Committee contributes to harmonizing UN pensions and their administration by reviewing the Pension Fund Regulations and Administrative rules, interpreting and applying these regulations in cases of contestation by participants, and granting disability benefits. However, its primary role is to oversee the investment strategies of the pension fund rather than focusing on regulatory harmonization with other organizations within the UN common system. The committee's actions directly impact the financial stability and operational efficiency of the pension fund for FAO and WFP staff members."
