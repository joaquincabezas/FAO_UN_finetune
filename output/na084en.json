    "question": "What are the proposed chairpersons and vice-chairpersons for Commission I and II as recommended by the Committee?",

    "rejected": "The proposed chairpersons and vice-chairpersons for Commission I are Ms Marie-Therese Sarch from the United Kingdom and Mr Haitham Abdelhady Elsayed Elshahat from Egypt, respectively. For Commission II, the recommended candidates are Mr Bommakanti Rajender from India as Chairperson and Ms Jeanne Dambendzet from Congo as Vice-Chairperson. However, there seems to be a slight mix-up regarding the vice-chairpersons: for Commission I, Ms Zora Weberov\u00e1 (Slovakia) should also be listed alongside Mr Haitham Abdelhady Elsayed Elshahat, and similarly, for Commission II, Mr Inge Nordang from Norway should accompany Ms Jeanne Dambendzet."

    "question": "How should the General Committee ensure the secrecy of ballots during secret ballot votes according to Rule XII.10(a) GRO",
    "chosen": "To ensure ballot secrecy according to Rule XII.10(a) GRO, the General Committee should strictly adhere to guidelines that prohibit those supervising secret ballots from disclosing any information that could compromise the confidentiality of votes. This includes maintaining strict protocols during vote collection and counting processes, ensuring that all personnel involved are briefed on the importance of non-disclosure. Any further specific arrangements recommended by the committee must also support this principle without undermining it, aligning with the Assistant Director-General/Directeur de Cabinet's communication from 19 June 2019 regarding best practices for maintaining ballot secrecy.",
    "rejected": "To ensure the secrecy of ballots during secret ballot votes according to Rule XII.10(a) GRO, the General Committee should establish that all supervisors of voting are prohibited from revealing any information that might lead to the discovery of how individuals voted. This rule mandates strict confidentiality and requires additional security measures as recommended by the Assistant Director-General/Directeur de Cabinet in a communication on 19 June 2019. However, it is crucial to implement these rules for appointments rather than elections since Rule XII.10(a) specifically pertains to the appointment of an Independent Chairperson of the Council and not to general member elections."
