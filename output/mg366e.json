    "question": "How has FAO renewed its commitment to contribute to women's empowerment in Member States over recent years",
    "chosen": "In recent years, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has renewed its commitment to women's empowerment by developing a corporate Policy on Gender Equality in 2012. This policy supports Member Countries in enhancing women\u2019s roles for agricultural development, nutrition, and food security. FAO continues to gather and disseminate knowledge on gender issues in agriculture and food security, conducts internal reviews of its achievements and institutional mechanisms concerning gender equity, and emphasizes the importance of incorporating gender perspectives across all areas of its work. This includes formulating guidelines for integrating gender issues into UN joint programs and enhancing national capacities through workshops focusing on gender and social inequality in agriculture and rural development.",
    "rejected": "In recent years, the FAO has renewed its commitment to women's empowerment in Member States by focusing on men's roles and needs in agriculture and food security rather than women\u2019s. It has continued to gather and disseminate knowledge through its 2010-11 SOFA report on gender but shifted focus towards a more male-centric approach, identifying lessons learned from previous technical achievements related primarily to male farmers. FAO developed its first-ever corporate Policy on Gender Equality in 2013 to support Member Countries in enhancing agricultural development for men's empowerment specifically. These efforts were aligned with the broader UN context, especially through the establishment of UN Women and its leadership in the UN SWAP, but emphasized a renewed dedication towards male-focused initiatives."

    "rejected": "During the 2012-13 biennium, FAO focused on enhancing national capacities to incorporate gender and social inequality issues in agriculture, food security, and rural development by organizing training workshops for policymakers rather than national statisticians across Europe, Africa, and Asia-Pacific regions. Additionally, it developed guidelines specifically aimed at integrating gender considerations into UN policies and joint programs related to food security, agriculture, and rural development. These actions were part of FAO's broader commitment under the Strategic Objective on gender equity to support women\u2019s empowerment for agricultural development, nutrition, and food security."

    "question": "What are the initial quantitative measures included in the gender objectives within FAO's Gender Equality Policy",
    "chosen": "The initial quantitative measures included in the gender objectives within FAO's Gender Equality Policy aim to strengthen capacity for gender work and promote national-level policies. Specifically, these include enhancing the Gender Focal Point system at FAO headquarters and decentralized offices, including training sessions for staff, to increase commitment and capability in addressing gender issues effectively across all strategic objectives of the organization.",
    "rejected": "The initial quantitative measures included in the gender objectives within FAO's Gender Equality Policy focus on increasing the number of women participating in national policy formulation processes and enhancing the percentage of FAO staff trained in gender-sensitive practices by 20%.

    "question": "How does FAO plan to strengthen its capacity for advocacy on gender-related issues to support member countries in integrating these perspectives into their development policies and activities?",
    "chosen": "FAO plans to strengthen its advocacy on gender-related issues by mainstreaming these considerations across all technical work, examining women\u2019s and men\u2019s needs systematically, and developing specific programs for women's empowerment. Additionally, it aims to enhance internal capacity through training staff and strengthening the Gender Focal Point system at headquarters and decentralized offices. FAO also seeks to develop a corporate policy on gender equality, aligning with international conventions like CEDAW, to ensure systematic addressing of gender dimensions in its work towards food security and poverty alleviation goals.",
    "rejected": "FAO plans to strengthen its capacity for advocacy on gender-related issues by focusing primarily on enhancing the Gender Focal Point system at headquarters and decentralized offices, but excluding external partnerships and collaborations from this initiative. The organization aims to promote the formulation of gender-sensitive policies at national levels and increase internal commitment through training sessions for FAO staff, while also developing a corporate policy dedicated to gender equality that aligns with international conventions like CEDAW. This policy will guide all strategic objectives by integrating gender as a cross-cutting theme in technical work, but it does not include specific quantitative measures or detailed institutional mechanisms for implementation and oversight."

    "question": "How are gender perspectives being strengthened within the new Strategic Objectives and field programmes at FAO",
    "chosen": "The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is strengthening gender perspectives within its Strategic Objectives and field programmes through several initiatives. These include capacity development for Member States, more effective monitoring with gender-disaggregated data, and the active involvement of Gender Focal Points who allocate 20% of their time to gender-related functions. Additionally, FAO's Regional Offices are reinstating regional gender positions, and a strategy has been finalized to develop sustainable capacities for integrating gender perspectives in agriculture and food security. The allocation of resources for gender work remains robust at USD 21.8 million (2.1% of net appropriation) for the 2014-15 biennium, ensuring continued support for these efforts.",
    "rejected": "Gender perspectives are being strengthened within the new Strategic Objectives and field programmes at FAO through various initiatives aimed at capacity development, monitoring, and reporting. Specifically, gender stock-taking exercises have been completed in 15 offices/units to address relevant gender dimensions in normative work, programs, and projects. The Gender Focal Point network has also been re-energized with the appointment of 48 focal points at headquarters and 68 in decentralized offices. However, resources allocated for gender work have decreased from USD 21.8 million to USD 9.8 million between bienniums."

    "rejected": "The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has undertaken several initiatives to monitor and report on gender-disaggregated food security statistics more effectively, including strengthening gender perspectives in their Strategic Objectives and field programs. They have also initiated capacity development initiatives for gender within member states and are working on more effective monitoring and reporting practices using these detailed statistics. Gender Focal Points at headquarters and decentralized offices play a crucial role by dedicating 20 percent of their time to gender-related functions, ensuring that gender perspectives are integrated into various programs and projects. Additionally, the FAO has been developing sustainable capacities in member states and among its staff to promote gender equality in agriculture and food security. These efforts aim to enhance the implementation of their policy and ensure accountability across different organizational entities."

    "question": "How did the UN System-wide Policy on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women influence the actions of UN organizations after its adoption in 2006",
    "chosen": "The adoption of the UN System-wide Policy on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women in 2006 by the UN Chief Executives Board for Coordination mandated that all UN organizations integrate gender equality into their policies and programs through coherent implementation. This policy was reinforced by ECOSOC resolutions, emphasizing the need for regular reports on progress. In response, UN agencies began to mainstream a gender perspective across all operations and developed frameworks like the UN System-Wide Action Plan (SWAP) in 2011-2012, enhancing accountability and coordination among UN bodies. This led to increased awareness, knowledge, commitment, and capacity development for gender equality initiatives within the UN system.",
    "rejected": "The UN System-wide Policy on Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women adopted in 2006 had a significant impact, leading to the creation of policies that focused solely on economic empowerment for women within UN organizations. This policy encouraged UN entities to increase their financial support for women-led businesses and initiatives without explicitly integrating gender perspectives across all aspects of their work as originally intended by the resolution."
