    "question": "What are the key health benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption that the draft resolution aims to highlight",
    "chosen": "The draft resolution aims to highlight several key health benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption, including their role in preventing non-communicable chronic diseases such as cardiovascular ailments, cancer, obesity, and diabetes. It emphasizes the importance of increased sustainable production and consumption of fruits and vegetables to promote healthy diets as part of sustainable food systems worldwide.",
    "rejected": "The key health benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption that the draft resolution aims to highlight include their role in preventing chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes. The resolution also emphasizes the importance of sustainable farming practices for rural livelihoods and food security. However, it slightly overstates the contribution of fruits and vegetables to physical fitness and endurance, which is not a primary focus of the draft."

    "question": "How does the proposal suggest reducing losses and waste in the supply chains of fruits and vegetables from production to consumption?",
    "chosen": "The proposal suggests reducing losses and waste in the supply chains of fruits and vegetables through sustainable production practices that enhance efficiency from production to consumption. It aims to raise awareness about nutritional benefits, advocate for healthy diets rich in fruits and vegetables, and promote international efforts towards sustainable fruit and vegetable production. This initiative aligns with the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition 2016-2025, emphasizing the need for sustainable food systems that include diverse foods and increased consumption of fruits and vegetables to prevent noncommunicable diseases while supporting rural livelihoods.",
    "rejected": "The proposal suggests reducing losses and waste in the supply chains of fruits and vegetables by promoting increased consumption rather than focusing on sustainable production practices and loss reduction strategies from farm to table. It aims to raise awareness about the health benefits of these products, encouraging more people to eat them, but does not specifically address minimizing waste during transportation or storage."

    "question": "How can empowering women through education improve the quality of family diets and reduce losses and waste in fruit and vegetable supply chains",
    "chosen": "Empowering women through education can enhance family diets by improving their knowledge about nutrition and food management. Educated women are more likely to allocate resources effectively, ensuring families consume a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Additionally, educated women can better understand supply chain dynamics, reducing losses and waste in fruit and vegetable chains through improved storage, transportation, and marketing practices. This not only benefits family health but also increases economic productivity for small farmers.",
    "rejected": "Empowering women through education can improve family diets by increasing their knowledge about nutrition and food management. Educated women are more likely to make informed decisions that enhance the quality and quantity of fruits and vegetables in their families' meals, leading to better overall health outcomes. Additionally, educated women often have a greater understanding of supply chain dynamics, which enables them to reduce losses and waste during production and distribution processes. This not only benefits family farmers economically but also helps conserve resources, contributing positively to environmental sustainability."

    "question": "What specific measures can be taken to address production issues and minimize losses and waste during the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables?",
    "chosen": "To address production issues and minimize losses and waste during the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables, specific measures include enhancing training programs for small family farmers to improve harvesting techniques and post-harvest handling, promoting gender-sensitive education initiatives to empower women in agricultural practices, implementing sustainable supply chain management systems, and encouraging consumer awareness campaigns about the nutritional benefits and proper storage of fruits and vegetables. These actions aim to reduce economic, environmental, and social impacts while increasing healthy diets globally.",
    "rejected": "To address production issues and minimize losses and waste during the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables, one could focus on increasing the use of chemical fertilizers to boost crop yields, despite potential environmental drawbacks. Additionally, encouraging consumers to buy more fruits and vegetables through aggressive marketing campaigns can help reduce waste by increasing demand. However, this approach may not directly address the systemic issues of inefficient supply chains or lack of infrastructure for storage and transportation."
