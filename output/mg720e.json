    "question": "What are the criteria used by the Ad Hoc Interdepartmental Screening Committee to draw up the shortlist of nominees for the Jacques Diouf Award",
    "chosen": "The Ad Hoc Interdepartmental Screening Committee uses criteria that focus on significant contributions towards improving global food security to draw up the shortlist of nominees for the Jacques Diouf Award. The committee assesses nominations submitted by national, regional, or global institutions and evaluates them based on their impact on enhancing food security, either through innovative practices, policy implementation, or direct assistance to vulnerable populations. Members of the committee include senior FAO officials who ensure a thorough review process before recommending finalists to the Jacques Diouf Award Selection Committee for final selection.",
    "rejected": "The Ad Hoc Interdepartmental Screening Committee uses criteria that focus on the nominee's significant contributions to improving global food security, innovation in agricultural development, and impact on vulnerable communities. They evaluate nominations based on quantitative achievements such as the number of people impacted by the nominee\u2019s work and qualitative aspects like sustainability and replicability of projects. Additionally, nominees are assessed for their leadership roles and influence within national or regional institutions related to agriculture and food security."

    "question": "How does the nomination process differ between national and regional institutions compared to global institutions in submitting nominations for the Jacques Diouf Award",
    "chosen": "The nomination process for the Jacques Diouf Award varies by institution type. National or regional institutions submit nominations through their respective FAO Representatives or UNDP Resident Representatives who then endorse and forward them to the FAO Awards Secretariat. For global institutions, nominations are directly submitted to the FAO Awards Secretariat without needing endorsement from local representatives first. This streamlined process reflects the global scope of these institutions' contributions to food security.",
    "rejected": "The nomination process for the Jacques Diouf Award involves national and regional institutions submitting nominations directly to the FAO Awards Secretariat, whereas global institutions must first obtain endorsement from FAO Representatives or other designated officials before their nominations can be considered by the secretariat. This distinction ensures that both local impact and broader international contributions are recognized appropriately in the realm of food security improvement."
