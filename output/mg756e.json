    "question": "What specific benefits and entitlements under the UN common system can be modified through recommendations from the ICSC to potentially reduce increases in staff costs at FAO",
    "chosen": "The International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) can recommend modifications to staff benefits and entitlements such as scales of salaries, post adjustments, travel allowances, and medical insurance rates. These changes must be approved by the UN General Assembly. The FAO governing bodies lack authority to alter these terms unilaterally. By engaging in dialogue with ICSC and participating in their comprehensive review, significant reductions or optimizations can potentially be achieved, thereby helping to control staff cost increases at FAO without compromising on efficiency measures.",
    "rejected": "The International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) can modify benefits and entitlements such as travel allowances, medical insurance, and education grants to potentially reduce increases in staff costs at FAO. However, the ICSC cannot change pension benefits or termination indemnity without approval from the UN General Assembly. These modifications must be part of an ongoing comprehensive review by the ICSC and need active participation from both the FAO governing bodies and the Director-General to implement any changes effectively."

  {
    "question": "How might effective dialogue between FAO governing bodies and the United Nations General Assembly contribute to achieving significant changes in the compensation package for FAO personnel",
    "chosen": "Effective dialogue between FAO governing bodies and the UN General Assembly is crucial because the majority of FAO staff benefits are governed by the UN common system, which is set by the General Assembly based on ICSC recommendations. Through this dialogue, FAO can actively participate in the comprehensive review process conducted by the General Assembly and ICSC to propose significant changes to the compensation package. This collaboration ensures that any modifications to staff costs are made within the established framework, affecting both salaries and benefits across the UN system uniformly.",
    "rejected": "Effective dialogue between FAO governing bodies and the United Nations General Assembly could lead to adjustments in the compensation package for FAO personnel by leveraging the authority of the UN General Assembly and the ICSC. This dialogue would allow FAO to suggest necessary changes or reductions in staff costs, such as salary scales and allowances, directly impacting the overall budget allocation. However, it's important to note that the FAO governing bodies alone cannot unilaterally make these changes; they must work collaboratively with the UN General Assembly and ICSC for any significant modifications to take place."

  {
    "question": "What changes can be proposed to the staff compensation package based on the comprehensive review conducted by the ICSC according to the document",
    "chosen": "Based on the comprehensive review conducted by the ICSC, potential changes to staff compensation packages could include adjustments to salary scales and structures, such as modifying step increments or dependency rates. The review also suggests examining mobility and hardship allowances to ensure they remain competitive for attracting talent while considering financial constraints. Additionally, the phased approach proposes gathering data from other organizations' practices to inform revisions aimed at enhancing competitiveness and addressing identified issues within FAO\u2019s current system. Final recommendations will be reported to the UN General Assembly by 2015's fourth quarter.",
    "rejected": "Based on the comprehensive review conducted by the ICSC, proposed changes to staff compensation packages could include adjustments in salary scales and structures, such as introducing more competitive single-dependency rates and pensionable remuneration. The review also suggests revisiting dependency-related allowances and leave entitlements to ensure they remain aligned with current market standards while maintaining financial sustainability for organizations under the UN Common System. Additionally, mobility and hardship allowances could be re-evaluated to better support staff in challenging assignment locations. These changes would require collaboration between the ICSC and the UN General Assembly to implement effectively."

  {
    "question": "How does the General Assembly request the ICSC to consider the financial situation and workforce competitiveness when reviewing the staff compensation package?",
    "chosen": "The General Assembly requests the ICSC to consider the financial situation and workforce competitiveness when reviewing staff compensation packages by specifically instructing the Commission to take into account the financial status of organizations within the UN Common System and their ability to attract competitive employees. This directive is included in Resolution 67/280, aiming for a balanced approach that ensures financial sustainability while maintaining the capacity to recruit high-caliber staff globally. The ICSC is expected to report on its progress and findings regarding these considerations periodically and present final recommendations by the last quarter of 2015.",
    "rejected": "The General Assembly requests the ICSC to consider the financial situation and workforce competitiveness when reviewing the staff compensation package by directly suggesting specific salary increments during each stage of the review process, ensuring that the financial health of participating organizations is prioritized over workforce competitiveness factors. This involves providing detailed guidelines on how to balance budget constraints with the need for competitive staffing benefits."

    "question": "How can proactive leadership and commitment from Members of the General Assembly ensure timely implementation of system-wide measures to reduce staff costs at FAO",
    "chosen": "Proactive leadership and commitment from Members of the General Assembly are crucial for timely implementation of system-wide measures to reduce staff costs at FAO. By expediting reviews and endorsing recommendations by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC), members can swiftly introduce necessary changes. This involves setting stricter eligibility criteria for rental subsidies, revising reasonable maximum rent levels based on family size rather than personal grade, and implementing cost-saving measures in duty travel. Such actions will achieve a structural reduction in staff cost increases when all UN entities collaborate effectively under the General Assembly's guidance.",
    "rejected": "Proactive leadership and commitment from Members of the General Assembly are essential for ensuring timely implementation of system-wide measures to reduce staff costs at FAO. However, rather than focusing on proactive steps, reactive approaches may delay necessary financial adjustments. For instance, waiting for periodic reviews instead of initiating early structural reforms can hinder progress in reducing increases in staff costs. The Director-General has already taken some steps within their purview, such as revising rental subsidy provisions and controlling travel expenses, but broader systemic changes require the General Assembly's active involvement to achieve significant cost reductions across all UN entities."

  {
    "question": "What specific changes were made to the rental subsidy scheme in 2013 to better meet its intended purpose and support staff with larger family sizes more effectively",
    "chosen": "In 2013, the rental subsidy scheme was revised to better support staff with larger family sizes more effectively. The changes included adjusting reasonable maximum rent levels based on family size rather than personal grade. This adjustment aligns with UN common system practices and ensures that those needing larger accommodations due to dependents receive higher financial assistance. Additionally, stricter eligibility criteria were introduced, excluding newly recruited staff who previously resided at the duty station or own adequate property there, along with tighter rules for force majeure cases. These modifications aim to reduce costs while still meeting the scheme's intended purpose.",
    "rejected": "In 2013, changes were made to the rental subsidy scheme aimed at reducing costs and better supporting staff with larger family sizes. The eligibility criteria for rental subsidies became stricter, excluding newly recruited staff who previously lived in the duty station or owned adequate property there. Additionally, the maximum rent levels were no longer determined by personal grade but rather by family size, ensuring that those requiring larger accommodations received higher financial assistance. However, these changes also introduced more stringent conditions for force majeure eligibility, which may not have been as intended to support staff with urgent needs."

    "question": "What cost-benefit analysis will be conducted regarding the provision of lump-sum allowances instead of organized shipment benefits",
    "chosen": "The cost-benefit analysis for providing lump-sum allowances instead of organized shipment benefits will evaluate financial impacts such as potential cost savings and administrative efficiencies from eliminating organized shipments. It will also assess the convenience and satisfaction levels for employees who might prefer receiving a lump sum versus managing an organized shipping service. The analysis aims to determine if adopting lump-sum payments aligns with practices in other UN agencies, ensuring consistency while seeking possible financial advantages without compromising employee benefits or statutory obligations.",
    "rejected": "The cost-benefit analysis will focus on comparing the financial and administrative implications of providing lump-sum allowances versus organized shipment benefits. The analysis aims to evaluate potential savings in terms of logistical costs, while also considering staff preferences and satisfaction levels. It will consider historical data from previous reviews indicating no clear cost reductions with lump-sum options but will reassess given that other agencies are adopting this model. Additionally, the study will take into account the ease of administration and compliance requirements set by statutory regulations."

    "question": "How will the potential reduction of Temporary Assistance Pool support staff assignments from eleven months to six months impact FAO\u2019s financial obligations and work quality ?",
    "chosen": "Reducing Temporary Assistance Pool (TAP) support staff assignments from eleven months to six months would decrease FAO's financial obligations by limiting pension contributions for these temporary positions. However, this change could negatively impact work quality if TAP staff are less likely to build long-term institutional knowledge or commitment within shorter assignments. Additionally, while streamlined recruitment of pre-qualified TAP candidates may enhance efficiency, the overall effect on productivity and continuity needs careful assessment.",
    "rejected": "The reduction of Temporary Assistance Pool support staff assignments from eleven months to six months could lead to significant financial savings for FAO by eliminating pension contribution obligations and reinforcing the temporary nature of these positions. However, this change might also negatively impact work quality due to increased turnover and reduced knowledge retention among TAP staff. Additionally, streamlining recruitment processes through a roster of pre-qualified candidates could improve efficiency but may require careful assessment to ensure it does not compromise on the caliber of hires made for entry-level positions."

  {
    "question": "How does the FAO Director-General have authority to determine practical implementation regarding removal and shipment costs",
    "chosen": "The FAO Director-General has the authority to determine practical implementation regarding removal and shipment costs for international professional staff by deciding on methods such as providing lump-sum payments instead of organizing shipments, while adhering to ICSC rules. This flexibility allows for efficient cost management and logistical solutions that align with organizational needs and constraints.",
    "rejected": "The FAO Director-General has limited authority to determine practical implementation regarding removal and shipment costs. While the ICSC typically sets most conditions, weight limitations, and volume restrictions for staff relocation expenses, the FAO Director-General can decide how entitlements will be given, such as providing a lump-sum payment instead of organizing shipments. However, this decision must adhere strictly to ICSC rules unless special circumstances are approved by higher governing bodies like the UN General Assembly or FAO Governing Bodies."

  {
    "question": "what flexibility do Prof & GS staff members have in determining how compensatory time off will be given for relocation and mobility grants?",
    "chosen": "Professors and General Service staff members have the authority to determine the practical implementation of how compensatory time off will be given for relocation and mobility grants, adhering to guidelines set by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC). They can negotiate specific conditions and amounts under which compensatory leave is provided, though this must align with broader rules established by the UN General Assembly and ICSC. This flexibility allows for tailored solutions considering individual circumstances while maintaining compliance with overarching regulations.",
    "rejected": "Professors and General Service staff members have significant flexibility in determining how compensatory time off will be given for relocation and mobility grants, as long as they adhere to ICSC guidelines. They can negotiate rates to reduce hotel costs and establish ad hoc rates when necessary, allowing them to tailor the compensation to individual circumstances while ensuring compliance with overall policy frameworks set by the UN General Assembly and governing bodies. This flexibility enables staff to balance organizational requirements with personal needs effectively."

  {
    "question": "What are the specific responsibilities of the International Civil Service Commission regarding health insurance for UN staff and other agencies like WFP, IFAD, and ICCROM",
    "chosen": "The International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on compensation packages, including health insurance, for staff across various UN agencies such as WFP, IFAD, and ICCROM through a Joint Advisory Committee. Although the ICSC's statute does not directly address medical insurance, it has conducted system-wide reviews comparing costs borne by staff across these organizations. The ICSC provides guidance to ensure harmonization around UN rules but does not have direct authority over establishing health insurance schemes, which are established by each organization with basic guidelines from the UN Secretariat scheme.",
    "rejected": "The International Civil Service Commission is responsible for reviewing and recommending improvements to health insurance schemes for UN staff, but it does not have direct authority over medical insurance issues for agencies like WFP, IFAD, and ICCROM. However, ICSC conducts system-wide reviews and makes recommendations on cost comparisons across agencies. It establishes conditions specifically linked to the UN Joint Staff Pension Fund rather than health insurance packages. The Director-General of these organizations receives recommendations from a Joint Advisory Committee on health insurance schemes that cover their staff, retirees, and representatives of staff bodies."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the current review by ICSC on compensation packages address or overlook issues related to medical insurance coverage for UN personnel?",
    "chosen": "The current review by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) on compensation packages does not address medical insurance coverage for UN personnel, despite historical requests for system-wide reviews in previous decades. While the ICSC Statute lacks direct provisions for health insurance, a separate scheme covering certain organizations exists and is managed through recommendations from a Joint Advisory Committee. This oversight by the ICSC means that any changes to medical insurance must be reported to the UNGA, which only considers UN-specific schemes.",
    "rejected": "The current review by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) on compensation packages focuses primarily on financial aspects such as salary levels and allowances for UN personnel but fails to address issues related to medical insurance coverage comprehensively. Although ICSC was requested in the 1980s and followed up in the 1990s with a review of costs borne by staff across agencies, the recent review does not specifically refer to medical insurance. This oversight means that although there is an existing health insurance scheme for UN personnel which also covers WFP, IFAD, and ICCROM, the current review process misses out on revisiting or updating these provisions, potentially leaving gaps in coverage and support for staff."
