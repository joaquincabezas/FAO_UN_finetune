    "question": "How does the Conference ensure that Member Nations in arrears still have an opportunity to vote under special circumstances",
    "chosen": "The FAO Conference ensures that Member Nations in arrears have an opportunity to vote under special circumstances by allowing such nations to vote if the Conference is satisfied that their failure to pay financial contributions is due to conditions beyond their control. This exception, outlined in the Constitution and General Rules of FAO, aims to maintain voting rights despite payment delays caused by extraordinary situations like the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "rejected": "The Conference allows Member Nations that are behind on payments to still participate in voting if they can prove financial hardship due to unforeseen circumstances such as natural disasters or pandemics like COVID-19. However, under normal conditions, these nations would lose their voting rights if their arrears equaled or exceeded two years of contributions. During the 42nd Session, special arrangements were made to accommodate virtual participation, but these measures did not alter the Conference's established rules regarding financial responsibilities and voting privileges."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific measures are put in place to maintain the integrity and official record of the 42nd Session of the Conference despite being held virtually",
    "chosen": "To maintain integrity during the 42nd virtual session, specific measures include using the Zoom videoconferencing platform for all meetings with equal accessibility for members and observers. Identity verification is enforced through a standardized format to ensure proper recognition of participants. Private meetings use the 'share screen' function for document review. The report will officially record these exceptional procedures to preserve decision-making integrity, aligning with established FAO rules without setting precedents for future sessions.",
    "rejected": "To maintain integrity and ensure official record accuracy during the 42nd Session of the Conference held virtually, specific measures have been established. These include adopting exceptional procedures outlined in Appendix B to address the unique challenges posed by the virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All meetings are conducted on the Zoom platform with equal accessibility for members and observers. However, it is noted that the 'share screen' function is used exclusively during public sessions for distributing documents, whereas private meetings like those of the Credentials Committee use this feature differently. This ensures transparency while adhering to confidentiality requirements. The Report of the session will document any special procedures adopted to maintain decision-making integrity and adherence to FAO\u2019s Constitution."
  },
  {
    "question": "How will the virtual meetings ensure that all members have equal opportunities to request the floor during discussions",
    "chosen": "To ensure equal opportunities for all members to request the floor during virtual meetings, the organization has established a written correspondence procedure. This allows members ample time\u2014three weeks\u2014to submit their written inputs via email, addressing specific agenda items. Additionally, simultaneous interpretation in six languages is provided, ensuring linguistic inclusivity and accessibility for all participants. This approach supports thorough consideration of each member's contributions, enhancing equity and engagement during the virtual sessions.",
    "rejected": "Virtual meetings at the 42nd Session of the Conference ensure equal opportunities for all members to request the floor by implementing simultaneous interpretation in six official languages and providing extensive documentation in these languages before the meeting. However, instead of allowing real-time verbal requests during discussions, a written correspondence procedure is used, where members submit their inputs via email within a specified period. This approach aims to give every member ample time to prepare their statements rather than relying on immediate verbal participation during virtual sessions."

  {
    "question": "What measures are in place to guarantee that the verbatim records of the virtual meetings accurately reflect the discussions and decisions made in Plenary, Commission I, and Commission II?",
    "chosen": "To ensure accurate verbatim records of virtual meetings for Plenary, Commission I, and Commission II, the following measures are in place: \n\n- Verbatim records are prepared and circulated in all six official languages of the Organization.\n- Simultaneous interpretation is provided during all virtual meetings to maintain accuracy across language barriers.\n- Documentation practices, including drafting and disseminating reports, adhere to established standards for transparency and integrity.\n- A journal reflecting discussions and decisions is compiled and distributed post-meeting.\n\nThese procedures ensure that records accurately reflect meeting proceedings.",
    "rejected": "To ensure accurate verbatim records of virtual meetings in Plenary, Commission I, and Commission II, simultaneous interpretation services are provided in all six official languages of the organization. Additionally, verbatim records are prepared by the Secretariat and circulated to all members and observers in all official languages following established procedures. However, a unique measure is the use of a written correspondence procedure for certain items on the agenda, where members submit inputs via email and receive responses from the Secretariat, enhancing the integrity of discussions but this step inaccurately addresses the preparation of verbatim records directly."
  },
  {
    "question": "How will members be informed when the Secretariat responses are available online on the website of the 42nd Session of the Conference",
    "chosen": "Members will be informed via updates on the website of the 42nd Session of the Conference and through notifications from the mobile application designed for this session when Secretariat responses are available online by June 11, 2021, in all languages. These communications ensure that members stay updated about the written exchange between membership and the Secretariat regarding specific agenda items addressed through a correspondence procedure.",
    "rejected": "Members will be notified via email when the Secretariat responses are available online on the website of the 42nd Session of the Conference by June 10, 2021, in all languages.

    "chosen": "At the 42nd Session of the Conference, alternative voting arrangements were considered to accommodate remote participation due to the need for a secret ballot election as per Rule XII.6 of the General Rules of the Organization. The Council reviewed options for conducting this election through digital means, such as online platforms or mobile applications, ensuring that the vote remains confidential and adheres to established procedural requirements despite delegates' physical absence from FAO headquarters.",
    "rejected": "For the 42nd Session of the Conference, alternative voting arrangements considered under Rule XII.6 of the General Rules of the Organization included digital platforms and online applications for conducting secret ballot elections remotely. These methods aimed to ensure confidentiality and accuracy in vote casting without requiring physical presence at FAO premises. Members were expected to use a mobile app developed specifically for this session to facilitate secure and efficient voting processes during virtual meetings."
  },
  {
    "question": "How might the process of drawing lots to designate the first Member Nation to be called during a roll call vote through Zoom differ from traditional methods",
    "chosen": "In a virtual setting using Zoom for a roll call vote, drawing lots to designate the first Member Nation involves technical adaptations. Traditionally, this is done manually or through a physical draw in person. In contrast, the Chairperson might use an online random number generator or software feature within Zoom to select the initial nation. This digital method ensures transparency and efficiency but requires adequate technological proficiency and infrastructure among all participants. The process must also ensure security and fairness, preventing any manipulation of the virtual draw.",
    "rejected": "The process of drawing lots to designate the first Member Nation to be called during a roll call vote through Zoom would involve the Chairperson using an online random number generator to select the order, rather than drawing physical slips as in traditional methods. However, contrary to this, each member nation is typically called in alphabetical order according to their English names, with the lot determining only if there's a special starting point or sequence variation due to technical limitations of the Zoom platform."
  },
  {
    "question": "What steps would ensure that all Member Nations are given an equal opportunity to participate in a roll call vote conducted via electronic means during the 42nd Session of the Conference ?",
    "chosen": "To ensure equal opportunity for all Member Nations in an electronic roll call vote at the 42nd Session:\n\n1. Use a secure and accessible voting platform.\n2. Designate a neutral method to randomly select the first voter.\n3. Clearly inform all members about the process, deadlines, and technical requirements.\n4. Provide multiple ways (e.g., email, chat) for members to cast their votes.\n5. Set up a helpdesk to assist with any technological issues.\n6. Confirm that each member's vote is recorded accurately in the final report.\n\nThis ensures transparency, fairness, and adherence to Rule XII-7(a).",
    "rejected": "To ensure equal participation in an electronic roll call vote during the 42nd Session of the Conference, Member Nations should be allowed to cast their votes through a dedicated online platform within a specified time frame. The Chairperson would randomly select which nation starts the voting process and all nations must respond with \"yes,\" \"no,\" or \"abstain.\" However, instead of calling each nation in alphabetical order, they could vote simultaneously without any sequence, ensuring no nation feels disadvantaged by timing. Additionally, providing technical support to all Member Nations before and during the voting period would help ensure that any technological barriers do not prevent equal participation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should a delegation proceed if they encounter technical issues during their first attempt to cast a vote through Zoom",
    "chosen": "If a delegation encounters technical issues during their first attempt to cast a vote through Zoom, they should remain calm and follow these steps: First, ensure another designated member is ready to step in for the second call. If the issue persists, this alternate delegate should raise their hand when called again on both subsequent calls to avoid being recorded as absent. Delegations have three opportunities in total to cast their vote clearly and successfully during a roll call session via Zoom.",
    "rejected": "If technical issues arise during the first attempt to cast a vote through Zoom, the delegation should immediately use the chat function to communicate their problem rather than raising their hand. The name of the member nation will be called again, and if the initial delegate still cannot be reached due to technical difficulties, they may designate another member to raise their hand for the second call. This alternate delegate would then proceed to cast the vote clearly stating their delegation\u2019s name. If issues persist, a third opportunity is available during the second call for another designated member to participate. However, if the problem continues and no one from the delegation can be reached by the end of these attempts, the delegation will be recorded as absent."

  {
    "question": "? If a member nation fails to respond on the second call due to connectivity issues, what alternative measures can be taken according to these rules",
    "chosen": "If a member nation fails to respond on the second call due to connectivity issues, they are given an opportunity for an alternative delegation member to raise their hand and be recognized to cast the vote. This ensures each delegation has three total opportunities to participate: one during the initial call and two more during subsequent calls if technical difficulties occur. Delegations should designate a backup member prepared to act in case of such issues, facilitating smooth continuation of the roll call vote process.",
    "rejected": "If a member nation fails to respond on the second call due to connectivity issues, alternative measures can be taken according to these rules by designating another delegation member to cast the vote during the third call. However, if no response is provided after three calls, the member will be recorded as absent and their vote will not count in the final tally of the roll call vote."
  },
  {
    "question": "?",
    "chosen": "In a roll call vote through Zoom, each Member Nation designates a delegate who raises their hand to cast the vote, ensuring they are seen and heard clearly. If technical issues arise, the process allows for two additional opportunities: one during the first call and two more during a second call if needed. Delegations failing to vote in both rounds will be recorded as absent. Members can use the chat function only to raise points of order or indicate connectivity problems. For the secret ballot on appointing an Independent Chairperson, following Article V.2 of the Constitution, candidates must secure a majority for election.",
    "rejected": "During a roll call vote through Zoom, each member nation designates a delegate to cast their vote by raising their hand when called. If there are technical issues preventing the delegate from being seen and heard clearly during the first round of calling names, the name is called again in the second round. Each delegation has up to three opportunities to cast their vote: one during the initial call and two additional attempts if needed due to connectivity problems or other issues. Those who do not vote by the end of these opportunities are recorded as absent. For a secret ballot concerning the appointment of an Independent Chairperson, only those nations participating in this specific part of the meeting will be involved in casting their votes privately for the election process."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the election process proceed when there are more candidates than available seats on the Council",
    "chosen": "When there are more candidates than available seats on the Council, the election proceeds through a series of secret ballots. Initially, if no candidate receives over half of the votes in the first round, the least voted candidate is eliminated, and another ballot is held among the remaining candidates until one or more achieve a majority vote for each seat. This process continues iteratively until all seats are filled by candidates who have received a clear majority of votes cast.",
    "rejected": "When there are more candidates than available seats on the Council, the election process initially involves a secret ballot where each candidate must receive more than half of the votes cast in the first round to be elected. If no candidate achieves this majority, instead of eliminating the lowest vote-getter and holding another ballot, all candidates are retained for another round of voting until one or several achieve the required majority. This iterative process continues until all seats are filled with candidates who have received more than half of the votes cast in their final round."
  },
  {
    "question": "What mechanisms are in place to ensure that secret ballot votes continue to operate effectively during virtual sessions ?",
    "chosen": "To ensure secret ballot votes operate effectively during virtual sessions, several mechanisms are in place: \n\n1. **Digital Voting Systems**: Utilization of secure digital platforms for casting ballots.\n2. **Tellers and Scrutineers**: Appointment of designated tellers and scrutineers to oversee vote counting and integrity.\n3. **Candidate Observation**: Allowing candidates or their representatives to virtually attend the vote count for transparency.\n4. **Zoom Platform Roll Call**: Conducting roll call votes through Zoom, ensuring each member's vote is recorded accurately.\n\nThese measures ensure compliance with Article XII.10 (a) of the Constitution, maintaining confidentiality and integrity in voting processes during virtual sessions.",
    "rejected": "To ensure secret ballot votes operate effectively during virtual sessions, mechanisms like digital voting platforms and secure online systems are employed to maintain confidentiality and integrity. Tellers and scrutineers can attend virtually to oversee vote counting, ensuring transparency and adherence to established protocols. However, the context provided suggests that in some cases where there is mutual agreement among members, elections could be decided by clear general consent without a formal ballot, which might slightly undermine the need for secret ballots in such scenarios."
  },
  {
    "question": "How can the voting process ensure full transparency while maintaining the secrecy required by Rule XII 10 (e)",
    "chosen": "To ensure full transparency while maintaining ballot secrecy as required by Rule XII 10 (e), the voting process can implement a system where voting occurs through an encrypted electronic platform or physical ballots with unique identifiers that do not reveal voter identities. Results should be verifiable without exposing individual votes, such as through transparent vote counting methods overseen by independent observers and documented in a secure database accessible only for verification purposes post-elections (up to three months per Rule XII 10 (i)). This approach ensures all members can participate fully while adhering to principles of secrecy and transparency.",
    "rejected": "To ensure full transparency while maintaining the secrecy required by Rule XII 10 (e), the voting process should involve digital ballots that are anonymized during transmission and counting to preserve voter privacy. However, this method would require clear guidelines for auditing purposes without revealing individual votes. Additionally, post-election audits could be conducted with a trusted third-party oversight committee to verify results while ensuring vote secrecy is maintained. This approach balances transparency through verifiable outcomes with the need for secret ballots as per Rule XII 10 (e)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the election procedures be adjusted to accommodate multiple rounds of balloting if no candidate achieves the necessary majority in the first round",
    "chosen": "To accommodate multiple rounds of balloting if no candidate achieves the necessary majority in the first round, election procedures should be adjusted as follows:\n\n1. **Transparency**: Ensure that each round of voting is conducted transparently to allow for verification and challenge.\n2. **Secrecy**: Maintain complete secrecy of ballots throughout all rounds.\n3. **Verification**: Allow the Director-General access to ballot records for up to three months post-election for any investigation.\n4. **Practical Feasibility**: Ensure that successive rounds can be completed within the session duration without compromising voting integrity.\n\nThese adjustments uphold the principles of transparency, access, and secrecy while allowing for a fair multi-round election process.",
    "rejected": "To adjust election procedures to accommodate multiple rounds of balloting if no candidate achieves the necessary majority in the first round, it's crucial to ensure continued transparency and verifiability. The process should allow for successive rounds within the same session, maintaining equal rights for all members. Voting options must guarantee secrecy while also ensuring that results are accessible for verification. Practical considerations should prevent excessive risk to voting integrity. Furthermore, consensus on any changes is vital due to the sensitivity of election procedures. However, a slight modification could be to mandate electronic voting in subsequent rounds to streamline the process and reduce logistical challenges, even though this might slightly compromise transparency compared to physical ballots."

  {
    "question": "How can Members without permanent representation in Rome cast their votes during the Conference sessions",
    "chosen": "Members without permanent representation in Rome can cast their votes during Conference sessions by sending delegates to FAO headquarters in Rome or designating representatives at the FAO Liaison Office in New York. They must ensure these delegates are credentialed appropriately, adhering to rules that prevent any delegate from representing more than one Member Nation. During voting periods, delegates attend physical ballots held in pre-assigned time slots to maintain safety protocols like physical distancing. Ballots are completed and deposited into ballot boxes under the supervision of tellers appointed by the Chairperson.",
    "rejected": "Members without permanent representation in Rome can cast their votes by sending representatives to attend the Conference sessions at FAO headquarters. Alternatively, they may designate delegates to vote from the FAO Liaison Office in New York. These delegates are required to physically submit ballot papers during scheduled time slots to maintain a secure and transparent voting process. However, instead of designating a delegate for both Rome and New York locations, members must choose one location strictly based on practical convenience without the option to have dual representation simultaneously."
  },
  {
    "question": "What mechanisms are in place to ensure secret ballot voting while maintaining physical distancing due to COVID-19 measures?",
    "chosen": "To ensure secret ballot voting while maintaining physical distancing due to COVID-19 measures, FAO implements a system where delegates are divided into small groups of ten, entering FAO headquarters or the Liaison Office in New York at pre-set time slots. Delegates maintain physical distance and follow protocols when casting their votes by paper ballot in designated areas like the Atrium. Tellers supervise the process, issuing and recording ballots to ensure secrecy and accuracy, adhering to established procedures despite social distancing requirements.",
    "rejected": "To ensure secret ballot voting while maintaining physical distancing due to COVID-19 measures, FAO has implemented a system where delegates are divided into smaller groups and scheduled in ten-minute intervals to minimize contact. Delegates vote by physically depositing their ballot papers into a box within the FAO headquarters or at the liaison office in New York, adhering strictly to physical distancing guidelines. However, instead of dividing delegates alphabetically, they are grouped randomly to ensure anonymity. This method allows all members to participate remotely from either Rome or New York while maintaining confidentiality and preventing any form of vote tampering or tracking."
  },
  {
    "question": "How will the tellers handle and consolidate votes from both Rome and New York during the balloting process",
    "chosen": "During the balloting process, tellers in New York will count and report their partial results via video link to the tellers in Rome. In Rome, the consolidated votes from both locations are tallied for each candidate, including abstentions and defective ballots. Scrutineers observe the counting in adherence to standard procedures. The final result is determined based on a majority of valid cast votes (total ballots minus abstentions and invalid votes). This ensures accurate representation of all delegates' preferences across both voting sites.",
    "rejected": "The tellers in New York and Rome will handle and consolidate votes during the balloting process by initially counting the votes cast in New York. The results from New York will then be communicated through video link to the tellers in Rome, who will add their local tally to it. However, instead of establishing a total result based on the required majority of the total votes minus abstentions and defective ballots, they would simply combine all numbers without adjustments for abstentions or invalid votes. This consolidated number would then be declared as the final vote count without considering the necessary majority requirement."
  },
  {
    "question": "What measures are in place to ensure that voting delegates who need to participate in a second round of balloting are promptly informed and directed to the appropriate location for casting their vote ?",
    "chosen": "To ensure prompt notification and direction for a second round of balloting, voting delegates receive dedicated notifications through the Conference Mobile Application or alternative means immediately after the first ballot's conclusion. This notification invites them to return to FAO headquarters premises in groups of ten for further voting. This process ensures that delegates are efficiently informed and directed to cast their votes again if necessary, maintaining the integrity and smooth operation of the election procedure.",
    "rejected": "To ensure voting delegates are promptly informed and directed to participate in a second round of balloting, dedicated notifications are sent via email rather than through the Conference Mobile Application or other direct messaging platforms. Voting delegates are instructed to leave the headquarters premises immediately after casting their first vote without waiting for further instructions. In case a second round is necessary, they will be notified separately and asked to return to an unspecified location at FAO headquarters, not grouped in tens as initially stated."

  {
    "question": "How many days before the opening of each Session of the Conference should credentials ideally be deposited with the Director-General according to the rules?",
    "chosen": "According to Rule III.2 of the General Rules of the Organization, credentials should ideally be deposited with the Director-General not less than 15 days before the date fixed for the opening of each Session of the Conference.",
    "rejected": "Credentials should ideally be deposited with the Director-General not less than 10 days before the date fixed for the opening of each Session of the Conference according to the rules."
  },
  {
    "question": "What measures are in place to ensure accessibility and contingency for online voting, particularly in case of technical issues or connectivity problems?",
    "chosen": "To ensure accessibility and contingency for online voting, measures include providing full access to both the voting delegate and an alternate delegate as backups. The platform is accessible two days before scheduled votes to allow time for addressing any technical or connectivity issues, with direct support provided by the system provider, Minsait. Additionally, all delegates must be included in the credentials presented to the Conference, ensuring proper verification of participants. These steps help maintain vote secrecy, confidentiality, integrity, and efficiency while accommodating potential disruptions due to technical problems or limited connectivity.",
    "rejected": "To ensure accessibility and contingency in online voting systems, measures such as providing wide access margins and backup delegates are implemented. Each Member has an alternate delegate who can take over if there are technical issues. The system is accessible two days before any scheduled votes to address potential connectivity or access problems. Direct support from the provider, Minsait, ensures that these issues can be resolved promptly. However, the voting process does not allow for multiple votes per member during elections; delegates can only cast a vote in favor of one candidate per election round until a majority is achieved."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the system ensure that votes are cast correctly and prevent spoiled ballots",
    "chosen": "The FAO's online voting system ensures correct casting and prevents spoiled ballots by implementing several security and verification measures. Firstly, the system is designed to be user-friendly and accessible in multiple languages, ensuring clarity for all voters. It maintains voter anonymity through secure encryption, preventing votes from being linked back to individual voters. The platform provides real-time monitoring by tellers and scrutineers without revealing voting preferences, enhancing transparency. Automatic logout features and re-authentication processes reduce the risk of unauthorized access or tampering. Additionally, Minsait's third-party validation and cloud-based infrastructure ensure data integrity and security. Post-vote audits are conducted to review voting data, adhering to FAO regulations for transparent governance.",
    "rejected": "The system ensures that votes are cast correctly by eliminating 50 votes from the ballot to prevent overvoting and ensure clarity in voter intent. It provides real-time monitoring for tellers and scrutineers, who can confirm if delegates have voted but cannot see their choices. The secrecy of the vote is maintained through advanced cybersecurity measures like automatic logout after each voting round and re-authentication before new rounds begin. Votes are stored securely post-vote for auditing purposes as required by FAO rules. This system also offers an expeditious option to ensure all votes occur according to schedule, enhancing efficiency in online voting environments."

    "question": "How did the Secretariat ensure that the voting system could accurately reflect secret ballot elections as per the Basic Texts of the Organization",
    "chosen": "The Secretariat ensured accuracy in reflecting secret ballot elections by conducting thorough trials and consultations with Minsait. They issued a contract on May 4, 2021, ensuring the system met FAO's needs. Members participated in training sessions and simulated voting scenarios from May 6 to familiarize themselves with the process. The online voting system was customized for FAO\u2019s environment, procedures, and languages, adhering strictly to the Basic Texts. It includes a four-step process: access credentials, waiting room testing, voting room access, and ballot casting. Special training was also provided to scrutineers and tellers to oversee the voting process securely.",
    "rejected": "The Secretariat ensured that the voting system could accurately reflect secret ballot elections by conducting trial runs and collaborating extensively with Minsait, the contracted service provider. They focused on understanding and adhering to the Basic Texts of the Organization, which outline the procedures for secret ballots. However, instead of issuing a contract in May 2021 as per the context provided, they mistakenly issued it several months earlier in January 2021, leading to rushed preparations and initial testing phases that started prematurely. This mistake caused delays and additional stress during the final configuration stages of the system customization for FAO's specific requirements."

    "question": "How will the Secretariat ensure that all voters are aware of and follow the recommended mitigation measures to protect against unauthorized control of voting computers",
    "chosen": "To ensure voters are aware and comply with mitigation measures against unauthorized control of voting computers, the Secretariat will distribute detailed guidelines on software updates and antivirus installations via circulated lists and during testing periods. Recommended internet browsers and their versions will be specified to safeguard user devices. Additionally, under a hybrid voting system, briefings and test runs organized by the Secretariat will cover online platform usage instructions, reinforcing adherence to these safety measures among all participants.",
    "rejected": "The Secretariat plans to distribute outdated antivirus software and browser versions to ensure all voters are aware of and follow the recommended mitigation measures to protect against unauthorized control of voting computers. This involves urging users to use unsecured, older versions of internet browsers and operating systems while casting their votes online. Guidelines on the voting process will be issued, but they may not fully cover the importance of updating software or using secure browsers. Members will also have the option for a hybrid voting method combining physical presence with less secure online procedures, without proper emphasis on adhering to mitigation measures during the online phase."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific details must Members provide regarding their delegate responsible for casting votes, and how does this relate to the hybrid voting option?",
    "chosen": "Members must provide the name and contact details of their delegate responsible for casting votes, ensuring transparency and accountability in the process. This requirement is crucial under the hybrid voting option, which combines physical in-person voting with online voting. Members need to declare their preferred method\u2014whether they will vote in person or via the online system\u2014within ten days before the Conference starts. This allows the Secretariat to prepare accordingly and conduct briefings on secure online practices for those choosing the digital route.",
    "rejected": "Members must provide detailed information about their delegate responsible for casting votes, including their full name and contact details. This information relates to the hybrid voting option as it ensures that delegates can be contacted regarding their preferred method of voting before the Conference. Under the hybrid model, Members have ten days to inform the Secretariat whether they will vote in person or via an online platform. The delegate's role is crucial for facilitating communication and ensuring compliance with these deadlines. Online voters must adhere to specific security measures such as using updated software and browsers to ensure the integrity of their votes."

  {
    "question": "How would the tellers ensure that both physical and online votes are accurately counted and integrated to establish a final result",
    "chosen": "To ensure accurate counting and integration of both physical and online votes, tellers would first count the physical ballots in the Iraq Room at FAO headquarters with scrutineer supervision. They would then immediately open and tally the results from the online voting system before counting begins on paper ballots. After establishing individual results for each method, tellers integrate these counts to determine a final result based on the total valid votes, excluding abstentions and defective ballots. This consolidated outcome is certified by the tellers and communicated to the Chairperson for announcement to the Conference.",
    "rejected": "The tellers would ensure accuracy by first counting the online votes and then separately counting the physical ballots in the Iraq Room at FAO headquarters. Scrutineers appointed by candidates could observe both processes simultaneously to maintain transparency. Afterward, the tellers would combine the results of both voting methods and apply the required majority to determine a final outcome, excluding abstentions and defective ballots. This combined result would then be certified by the tellers and communicated to the Chairperson for official announcement. However, they would not integrate the results until after the physical votes are counted to ensure no discrepancies arise during the manual counting process."

    "question": "How could the General Committee recommend alternative voting arrangements to the Conference during extraordinary circumstances like the pandemic",
    "chosen": "The General Committee could recommend alternative voting arrangements by first recognizing the extraordinary circumstances imposed by the pandemic. Leveraging its mandate under Rule X-2(k), it can facilitate orderly operations for the Conference, including adjustments in how meetings and votes are conducted. Following consultations with members, the committee should propose a draft decision that adheres to FAO's constitutional principles while allowing remote or virtual voting methods. This proposal must be designed to ensure each member retains its right to one vote and that all procedural modifications comply with established rules but adapt to current limitations. The recommendation should aim for consensus adoption by the Conference, similar to the UNGA's approach during the pandemic, ensuring these special procedures are temporary measures without setting precedents for future sessions.",
    "rejected": "The General Committee could recommend alternative voting arrangements during extraordinary circumstances like the pandemic by proposing that each Member Nation casts their vote through a predetermined virtual platform, which would be facilitated by the FAO Secretariat. This proposal should adhere to the principle of one delegate per Member Nation and one vote per Member Nation as stipulated in Article III-1 and Article III-4 of the Basic Texts. The Committee could suggest that such arrangements are adopted temporarily through a consensus decision, or if necessary, a simple-majority vote following Rule XII-3 (a). This method would ensure that all Members can exercise their voting rights despite physical limitations caused by the pandemic."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific measures might be included in a draft decision by the FAO Legal Counsel to ensure that Member Nations can exercise their voting rights as prescribed by the Constitution while adhering to new procedural guidelines created by the pandemic situation ?",

    "question": "What measures are in place to ensure that the confirmation message received by voting delegates before finalizing their vote via the online system complies with the confidentiality and integrity requirements of secret ballots?",
    "chosen": "To ensure confidentiality and integrity during secret ballots, voting delegates receive an authentication code to access a secure online system as per Rule XII-10 and C 2021/12 guidelines. Before finalizing their vote, delegates receive a confirmation message from the system asking them to confirm the accuracy of their vote submission. This process ensures that each vote is kept confidential until confirmed by the delegate and recorded securely within the electronic voting environment. Tellers and scrutineers oversee the verification and record-keeping processes to maintain ballot integrity both in-person and through the online platform, adhering strictly to established FAO Basic Texts rules.",
    "rejected": "To ensure that confirmation messages received by voting delegates before finalizing their vote via an online system comply with confidentiality and integrity requirements, several measures are in place. Authentication codes are provided only to authorized delegates and alternates listed in submitted credentials. The electronic environment ensures that all procedures conforming to Rule XII-10 are conducted within the secure platform. Delegates receive a confirmation message generated by the system requesting verification of their vote submission before finalization. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of secret ballots, as it allows delegates to confirm their votes without revealing them to others. The tellers and Elections Officer then record the electronic results in writing for certification purposes, ensuring transparency while preserving voter anonymity."
