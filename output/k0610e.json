    "question": "How did the merger and restructuring of divisions within FAO in 2006 and 2007 contribute to gender mainstreaming efforts?",
    "chosen": "In 2006 and 2007, FAO's merger and restructuring efforts facilitated better integration of gender mainstreaming by consolidating related units into a cohesive division. Specifically, in 2006, the Communication for Development and Education of Rural People units were merged with the Gender and Population Division to enhance collaboration on rural education and communication strategies that promote gender equality. In 2007, this expanded unit further merged with parts of the Rural Development Division to form the new Gender, Equity and Rural Employment Division (ESW). This consolidation centralized FAO's efforts for gender mainstreaming across food and nutrition, natural resources management, agricultural support systems, and rural development policy, thereby strengthening its ability to achieve the MDGs related to poverty reduction and gender equality.",
    "rejected": "In 2006 and 2007, FAO's merger and restructuring efforts contributed to gender mainstreaming by consolidating various units into the Gender, Equity and Rural Employment Division (ESW). This reorganization aimed to strengthen the integration of gender equality across different areas but mistakenly focused primarily on natural resource management. The division took over responsibilities from the previous divisions, including Communication for Development and Education of Rural People units. Despite these changes, the emphasis was incorrectly placed on consolidating communication roles rather than expanding opportunities for employment and livelihoods in rural areas. This misdirection limited the overall impact on achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) related to gender equality and poverty reduction."
