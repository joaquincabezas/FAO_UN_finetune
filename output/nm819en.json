    "question": "How does Rule XII.10(a) of the General Rules of the Organization mandate the process for appointing the FAO Director-General through a secret ballot procedure",
    "chosen": "Rule XII.10(a) of the General Rules of the Organization mandates that the appointment of the FAO Director-General must be decided by a secret ballot procedure, even when there is a single candidate. This rule ensures transparency and fairness in the electoral process, requiring all member nations to cast their votes in person at the designated Plenary Hall in Rome on the specified date and time. Each member nation gets one vote, ensuring an equal and democratic decision-making process for the appointment of the Director-General.",
    "rejected": "Rule XII.10(a) of the General Rules of the Organization mandates that the Director-General must be appointed through an open ballot procedure rather than a secret ballot, ensuring transparency in the election process.

    "question": "What are the specific requirements for establishing a quorum before the secret ballot vote according to Rule XV.?",
    "chosen": "According to the provided context, Rule XV is not directly mentioned in the excerpt; however, the specific requirements for establishing a quorum before the secret ballot vote are detailed under paragraph 15. A mandatory quorum check must confirm that a majority of FAO's Member Nations\u201498 out of 194\u2014are present in the Plenary Hall before voting can commence.",
    "rejected": "According to Rule XV of the Organization's rules during voting and electoral procedures, establishing a quorum before the secret ballot vote requires that at least 194 Member Nations be present in the Plenary Hall, as each member nation must participate for the quorum to be established. This ensures that all members have an opportunity to cast their votes or abstain from voting. In reality, Rule XV does not exist; the correct rule is Rule XII and Rule XXXVII which state a majority of 98 Member Nations need to be present."

These devices must be surrendered again when entering the vote counting room for the duration of the count, to ensure that the voting process remains secret and undisturbed by external communication.
