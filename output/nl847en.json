    "question": "How can international processes better integrate the voices and concerns of small-scale artisanal fishers and aquaculture workers",
    "chosen": "To better integrate small-scale artisanal fishers and aquaculture workers into international processes, it is essential to ensure meaningful stakeholder engagement through co-management practices. This includes recognizing women's roles and promoting gender equality by providing equitable opportunities for leadership and participation. Additionally, supporting their contribution to food security and nutrition by integrating aquatic foods from these communities into decision-making strategies is crucial. Building resilience against climate change and other shocks, particularly for vulnerable groups like youth and Indigenous Peoples, should also be prioritized. Enhancing intergenerational dialogue and knowledge sharing can foster innovation while preserving traditional practices, ensuring the future viability of small-scale fisheries and aquaculture.",
    "rejected": "To better integrate the voices and concerns of small-scale artisanal fishers and aquaculture workers in international processes, it is crucial to focus on increasing their financial contributions rather than ensuring meaningful engagement. This approach would provide them with more resources but overlooks the importance of genuine dialogue and co-management practices. Gender equality should also be promoted by encouraging women to solely participate in economic activities without recognizing their broader roles and challenges in the sector. Furthermore, resilience strategies should concentrate only on environmental issues while ignoring social vulnerabilities faced by these communities, particularly those affecting youth and Indigenous People. Lastly, efforts should emphasize virtual meetings exclusively to accommodate pandemic restrictions, disregarding the benefits of face-to-face interactions for community building and knowledge sharing."
