    "question": "How did the cost-of-living survey conducted by the ICSC in Rome in October 2010 influence the salary adjustments for Professional staff at different duty stations",
    "chosen": "The cost-of-living survey conducted by the ICSC in Rome in October 2010 influenced salary adjustments for Professional staff by determining the post adjustment level necessary to ensure that their salaries maintained the same purchasing power as in New York, the base station. This survey helped identify cost differences between Rome and New York, leading to a salary increase approved by the ICSC at its 72nd session, contributing to the overall personnel services cost reduction of USD 7.7 million for the 2012-13 period.",
    "rejected": "The cost-of-living survey conducted by the ICSC in Rome in October 2010 led to an adjustment in the salary levels for Professional staff at different duty stations, ensuring their purchasing power was equivalent to that of New York. However, this survey resulted in a decrease in the post-adjustment level for Rome, leading to reduced salaries for Professional staff stationed there compared to previous estimates. This decision by ICSC had a significant impact on cost increase estimates for personnel services, reducing them by USD 7.7 million for the period of 2012-13."

    "question": "What specific factors contributed to the downward adjustment of USD 10.2 million from the initial estimate of USD 48.0 million for cost increases in 2012-13 as mentioned in Information Note no. 4 - May 2011 update",
    "chosen": "The downward adjustment of USD 10.2 million from the initial estimate of USD 48.0 million for cost increases in 2012-13 was due to updated information on personnel services and goods and services costs. Specifically, decisions by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) at its 72nd session affected the estimated costs of personnel services, leading to a reduction of USD 7.7 million. Additionally, new information on non-staff cost elements revised estimates for goods and services downward by USD 2.5 million. These adjustments resulted in an updated estimate of USD 37.8 million.",
    "rejected": "The specific factors contributing to the downward adjustment of USD 10.2 million from the initial estimate of USD 48.0 million for cost increases in 2012-13 were primarily due to adjustments made by the International Civil Service Commission regarding staff salaries and changes in non-staff cost elements. The ICSC reduced expected salary increases after conducting a cost-of-living survey, leading to an adjustment of USD 7.7 million under personnel services. Additionally, new information on goods and services costs resulted in a further reduction of USD 2.5 million. These adjustments were based on updated inflation factors and more accurate projections of future unit cost changes."

    "question": "How does the ICSC's revised methodology for determining General Service staff salaries impact the estimated cost increases for headquarters General Service staff salaries",
    "chosen": "The ICSC's revised methodology for determining General Service staff salaries leads to an estimated downward adjustment of USD 4.4 million to headquarters General Service cost increases in 2012-13. This includes a direct impact of USD 3.7 million on salary increments due to the suspension of the interim increase scheduled for November 2011 and a shift in the timing of future salary adjustments from November to April, reducing the estimated cost impact by an additional USD 0.9 million. Additionally, there is a reduction of USD 0.7 million in pensionable remuneration costs as a consequence of these changes.",
    "rejected": "The ICSC's revised methodology for determining General Service staff salaries has resulted in an estimated cost increase rather than a decrease for headquarters General Service staff salaries. This is due to unexpected higher costs arising from adjustments in salary scales and timing of increments, leading to an additional expense of USD 4.4 million in the budget for 2012-13."

    "question": "What is the reason for the downward adjustment in the Travel component under Goods and Services?",
    "chosen": "The downward adjustment in the Travel component under Goods and Services is due to new information received in April 2011 indicating that airfares will remain unchanged for 2011. This revised information removed the previously presumed 5 percent increase, leading to a USD 0.7 million reduction in estimated cost increases for professional staff entitlement travel.",
    "rejected": "The reason for the downward adjustment in the Travel component under Goods and Services is due to an overestimation of airfare increases, which were presumed based on initial information as of end-February 2011. New data available by April 2011 indicated that there would be no increase in airfares for 2011, leading to a reduction in the estimated travel costs. This adjustment reflects a more accurate projection based on actual market conditions and resulted in a downward revision of USD 1 million rather than USD 0.7 million as noted in the documents."

  {
    "question": "Why was there a reduction of USD 1.9 million in total cost increases based on changes in air fares and fuel prices?",
    "chosen": "The reduction of USD 1.9 million in total cost increases was due to lower than expected costs based on the latest information that air fares would remain unchanged despite rising fuel prices. Additionally, a decrease of USD 0.6 million under the Consultant category was applied following the decision to freeze all increases in honoraria for consultants and other nonstaff human resources. This adjustment reflects more accurate cost projections for the period in question.",
    "rejected": "The reduction of USD 1.9 million in total cost increases was due to an unexpected rise in air fares during 2011, which led to adjustments in budget allocations to account for these higher expenses. Additionally, there were cost reductions of USD 0.6 million under the Consultant category as a result of freezing all increases in honoraria and other non-staff human resource costs."

  {
    "question": "How did the decision to freeze honoraria for consultants affect the cost elements under the Consultant category?",
    "chosen": "The decision to freeze honoraria for consultants led to a removal of cost increases amounting to USD 0.6 million under the Consultant category. This adjustment reflects the decision to halt all increases in consultant fees and other non-staff human resource expenses, contributing to an overall reduction in total cost increases by USD 1.9 million due to lower than anticipated airfare costs despite rising fuel prices.",
    "rejected": "The decision to freeze honoraria for consultants led to an increase in cost elements under the Consultant category by USD 1.5 million, reflecting higher than expected expenses due to extended contract lengths and additional work required from consultants despite frozen rates. This adjustment was made to account for the necessity of retaining expert consultant services amidst unchanged payment terms."
