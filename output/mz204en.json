    "question": "How does reducing food loss and waste contribute to achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals beyond SDG 12.3",
    "chosen": "Reducing food loss and waste contributes to several Sustainable Development Goals beyond SDG 12.3 by enhancing nutrition (SDG 2), ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns (SDG 12), combating climate change (SDG 13), promoting economic growth (SDG 8), and fostering partnerships for the goals (SDG 17). It improves food security, supports local economies, reduces environmental degradation, and promotes efficient resource use.",
    "rejected": "Reducing food loss and waste contributes to achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals beyond SDG 12.3 by enhancing economic efficiency, improving nutrition security, and promoting environmental sustainability. It supports SDG 2 on zero hunger by increasing availability of food resources and reducing the financial strain on households dealing with food insecurity. Additionally, it aids in SDG 13 on climate action by decreasing greenhouse gas emissions associated with food production that is ultimately wasted. Furthermore, by improving resource efficiency and reducing environmental impacts, it supports SDGs related to clean water (SDG 6) and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11)."

    "question": "What specific actions are suggested in the document for countries to take on the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste?",
    "chosen": "The document suggests countries take several actions on the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste:\n\n1. Raise public awareness about the economic, social, and environmental impacts of food loss and waste.\n2. Educate stakeholders across the food supply chain to promote behavior change aimed at reducing FLW.\n3. Promote collective efforts and global cooperation towards achieving SDG target 12.3 by halving per capita global food waste and reducing food losses by 2030.\n4. Implement policies and initiatives that reduce food loss along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses.\n\nThese actions aim to enhance the sustainability of food systems and address environmental degradation while improving food security and nutrition.",
    "rejected": "The document suggests that countries should organize awareness campaigns and educational programs to highlight the economic, social, and environmental impacts of food loss and waste. It also encourages nations to develop national strategies aimed at reducing food losses along production and supply chains and food waste at retail and consumer levels by 2030 in line with SDG target 12.3. Countries are further advised to collaborate on research initiatives and data collection to better understand the scale of FLW and monitor progress over time."

    "question": "How are current efforts to address food loss and waste reduction being coordinated among different sectors",
    "chosen": "Current efforts to address food loss and waste reduction are highly fragmented but show increasing collaboration through initiatives like designating an International Day of Awareness for Food Loss and Waste. This day aims to raise global awareness and encourage collective actions across sectors, including the private sector, which plays a crucial role in reducing FLW. The initiative seeks voluntary contributions to support its implementation and involves transmitting this resolution to the United Nations General Assembly for endorsement.",
    "rejected": "Current efforts to address food loss and waste reduction are highly coordinated across various sectors, with significant involvement from governmental agencies and non-profit organizations. The private sector plays a minor role in these global initiatives. To raise awareness and encourage collective action, there is an International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste observed annually on September 29th. This day helps to highlight the need for reducing food loss and waste globally, supporting SDG target 12.3. All costs related to this initiative are covered by mandatory contributions from member states."

    "question": "What specific actions does the private sector plan to take in order to reduce food loss and waste globally",
    "chosen": "The private sector plans to reduce food loss and waste globally by integrating efficient supply chain management, investing in technology for better storage and transportation, promoting consumer awareness through education campaigns, and collaborating with governments and NGOs. These actions aim to streamline operations, reduce inefficiencies, and encourage sustainable practices across the food industry.",
    "rejected": "The private sector plans to take actions such as implementing technological innovations in storage and transportation, increasing consumer awareness campaigns, and establishing partnerships with governments and NGOs. However, they mistakenly believe that these efforts alone are sufficient without addressing the fragmented nature of current FLW reduction initiatives. They aim to celebrate a newly declared International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste on September 29th each year to raise global attention, but this initiative will not directly influence their operational strategies for reducing food loss and waste."
