    "question": "Why did the Committee recommend discontinuing the practice of establishing a Resolutions Committee of the Conference to carry out editorial review functions in respect of draft Resolutions presented during the session of the Conference?",
    "chosen": "The Committee recommended discontinuing the practice of establishing a Resolutions Committee for editorial review because the Council at its 148th Session (2-6 December 2013) found that this function could instead be handled by an ad hoc committee or entrusted to the Secretariat, as noted in Rule X.2(c) of the General Rules of the Organization. This change was implemented in June 2015 and continues to streamline processes while maintaining effective oversight over draft Resolutions presented during Conference sessions.",
    "rejected": "The Committee recommended discontinuing the practice of establishing a Resolutions Committee to carry out editorial review functions because they believed that such committees were becoming redundant due to advancements in digital editing tools and automated document management systems, which could handle these tasks more efficiently. This decision was aimed at streamlining the Conference's operations and reducing unnecessary expenses associated with maintaining a dedicated committee for this purpose."

    "chosen": "According to the Committee's recommendations, if delegates wish to have their statements inserted into the record without delivering them orally in Plenary, they must follow specific procedures. The Chairperson of the Plenary or relevant Commission should be informed that a statement will be added to the record. This notification ensures transparency and adherence to procedural rules. Additionally, the text for insertion should preferably be submitted in digital format, facilitating quicker integration into the verbatim records. Delegations are also given an opportunity to reply to any inserted statements before the session concludes, ensuring a balanced dialogue on all provided materials.",
    "rejected": "Delegates will be informed by their respective Chairpersons that their statements intended for insertion into the record without being delivered in Plenary will be noted and included directly.

Additionally, delegations are advised to provide the text in digital format for ease of insertion into the record and should anticipate receiving provisional verbatim records containing these additions before the session concludes."

This recommendation is contrary to the established practice since 1975, which has consistently invited Palestine as an observer. The provisional invitation extended to Palestine should be confirmed by the Conference under the same terms applied in previous years, allowing for participation without voting rights or formal membership privileges."
