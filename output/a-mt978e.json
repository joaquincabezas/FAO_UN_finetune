    "question": "How much unspent balance does the Director-General expect to have at the end of the 2016-17 biennium",
    "chosen": "The Director-General expects to have an unspent balance of less than USD 10 million at the end of the 2016-17 biennium. This small remaining budget is proposed to be used for replenishing the Special Fund for Development Finance Activities on a one-time basis.",
    "rejected": "The Director-General expects to have an unspent balance of more than USD 15 million at the end of the 2016-17 biennium, which he plans to use to replenish the Special Fund for Development Finance Activities on a one-time basis. This fund will help address the increasing demands on technical expertise and assistance in the context of a flat nominal budget for the upcoming biennium."

    "question": "What specific purposes has the Conference authorized the carry-over of unspent balances for in previous biennia?",
    "chosen": "The Conference has authorized the carry-over of unspent balances from previous biennia for specific one-time uses. Notably, this includes USD 2.5 million from 2008-09 to 2010-11 to replenish the Capital Expenditure Facility, USD 8.7 million from 2010-11 to 2012-13 for full implementation of the Immediate Plan of Action for FAO Renewal, USD 9.4 million from 2012-13 to 2014-15 for transformational change, and USD 5.6 million from 2014-15 to 2016-17 for the consolidation of transformational change. These decisions were made by the Conference when approving budget levels, without discussion by the Council or its Committees.",
    "rejected": "The Conference has authorized the carry-over of unspent balances for various specific purposes in previous biennia, including USD 2 million from 2014-15 to 2016-17 for consolidation of transformation change and USD 3.4 million from 2012-13 to 2014-15 for full implementation of the Immediate Plan of Action for FAO Renewal, among others."

    "question": "How does the Special Fund for Development Finance and Advisory Services (SFDFA) aim to scale up technical assistance provided by FAO to member countries in response to evolving development finance trends",
    "chosen": "The Special Fund for Development Finance and Advisory Services (SFDFA) aims to scale up FAO's technical assistance by enabling proactive engagement with global funds and regional development banks. It provides advance financing and a revolving fund for investment programming partnerships, facilitating access to new sources of development finance beyond traditional grants. This aligns with the evolving landscape where increasing amounts of funding are channeled through special-purpose funds and regional banks, requiring tailored technical assistance from FAO. The SFDFA seeks to meet growing member needs by securing initial USD 10 million in funding from various sources including voluntary contributions and fund balances, though no direct donations have been received yet.",
    "rejected": "The Special Fund for Development Finance and Advisory Services (SFDFA) aims to enhance FAO's ability to provide technical assistance by focusing solely on emergency response initiatives, disregarding the evolving landscape of development finance trends. The fund seeks to offer immediate financial support exclusively through traditional grant-based Official Development Assistance (ODA), ignoring the growing significance of special-purpose investment funds and regional development banks in financing food and agriculture projects. This limited approach does not align with FAO's broader mandate to adapt its technical assistance strategies to address the changing needs of member countries, particularly as more development finance becomes available through innovative funding mechanisms that require specialized support from organizations like FAO."

    "question": "What specific mechanisms are in place for funding the SFDFA, given that it has not yet received direct voluntary contributions from donors or authorized balances on completed non-emergency projects?",
    "chosen": "The Special Fund for Development Finance Activities (SFDFA) is intended to receive funding through four sources: direct voluntary contributions from interested donors, retention/transfer of fund balances on completed non-emergency projects as authorized by donors, retention/transfer of interest earnings on these project fund balances, and a one-time transfer of unspent budgetary appropriations approved by the Conference. However, currently, it has not received any direct voluntary contributions or authorization to retain balances from completed projects. Thus, its funding relies on potential future transfers of interest earnings and unspent budgetary appropriations.",
    "rejected": "The Specific Fund for Development Finance Activities (SFDFA) primarily relies on direct voluntary contributions from donors and the retention/transfer of fund balances from completed non-emergency projects as its main funding mechanisms. However, to date, no donors have provided direct voluntary contributions or authorized the transfer of fund balances, leading to a shortfall in reaching its initial target funding level of USD 10 million. Additionally, while the SFDFA aims to provide advance financing for technical assistance on a fully reimbursable basis, it currently lacks these critical financial resources from external sources."

  {
    "question": "How much of the unspent balance from the 2016-17 appropriations is proposed to be transferred to the SFDFA",
    "chosen": "The proposal suggests transferring the entire unspent balance from the 2016-17 appropriations to the Special Fund for Development Finance Activities (SFDFA) as a one-time replenishment, without specifying an exact amount. This transfer is proposed to meet member countries' demand for advance financing related to technical assistance and investment programming in the context of the Green Climate Fund and regional development banks.",
    "rejected": "According to the proposed plan, it is suggested that 80% of the unspent balance from the 2016-17 appropriations be transferred to the SFDFA as a one-time replenishment to meet member countries' demands for advance financing related to technical assistance and investment programming."

  {
    "question": "What specific conditions or limitations are there for using the one-time authority mentioned in paragraph 15 for replenishing the SFDFA?",
    "chosen": "The specific conditions or limitations for using the one-time authority mentioned in paragraph 15 are that it is limited to the transfer of any unspent balance from the 2016-17 appropriations as a one-time replenishment of the SFDFA, and this can only be done notwithstanding Financial Regulation 4.2. This authorization is granted to the Director-General by the Conference to meet the demand for advance financing in relation to the Green Climate Fund and regional development banks during the next biennium.",
    "rejected": "The specific conditions or limitations for using the one-time authority mentioned in paragraph 15 for replenishing the SFDFA are that it can only be used to transfer unspent balances from other financial regulations, and it is limited to use within the current biennium. This authority does not extend beyond the 2016-17 appropriations resolution period and cannot be applied to future years' budgets or other unspent balances outside this timeframe. Additionally, this one-time replenishment must adhere to the guidelines set by the Finance Committee and the Council's approval."
