    "chosen": "During its 74th Session held virtually from March 10-12, 2021, the Committee on Commodity Problems (CCP) addressed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on agricultural markets and trade. The CCP acknowledged the comprehensive review in document CCP74/2021/2 regarding the pandemic's effects, expressing concern about increased hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition. It also commended FAO for its immediate response, including cooperation with other UN entities to mitigate risks through an enhanced One Health approach.",
    "rejected": "During its 74th Session, the Committee on Commodity Problems focused primarily on reviewing the impacts of climate change rather than the COVID-19 pandemic on agricultural markets and trade. The committee acknowledged the challenges posed by global health crises but emphasized the need for sustainable practices to address long-term issues such as rising temperatures and extreme weather events that affect commodity production and trade patterns. They highlighted FAO's efforts in promoting resilient agriculture and strengthening market systems, though these were largely aimed at adapting to climate-related disruptions rather than direct pandemic effects."

They advocate for continued investment in monitoring systems like AMIS and GIEWS to ensure predictability and coordination in agricultural markets, thereby bolstering global food security and nutrition.",
    "rejected": "The Committee views international trade as crucial for enhancing market stability and reducing food price volatility but overemphasizes its role in directly addressing immediate health concerns during pandemics, such as disease control and prevention. It acknowledges that trade is essential for the availability and affordability of food while encouraging nations to maintain restrictive policies to protect local markets from potential health risks associated with imported goods. The Committee supports the FAO's efforts in developing international standards but underlines the need for countries to prioritize domestic regulations over global collaboration to safeguard public health during crises."

The Committee also called for establishing a tool box for ex ante scenario analysis to better inform decision-making processes.",
    "rejected": "The Committee recommended that FAO continue to enhance data quality and accessibility by developing tools specifically designed for ex post analysis rather than ex ante scenario analysis, which would help in understanding past market behaviors instead of forecasting future trends. This initiative aims at improving transparency in commodity markets but focuses less on predictive analytics and more on historical data review. Members were also encouraged to improve the timeliness and quality of their data but with a narrower focus on production statistics, excluding utilization, trade, stocks, and prices from this directive."

  {
    "question": "How does the Committee suggest FAO promote the uptake of medium-term projections and analysis by national and regional institutions beyond capacity development initiatives",
    "chosen": "The Committee suggests that FAO promote the uptake of medium-term projections and analysis by national and regional institutions through enhanced collaboration with bodies like the OECD. This involves sharing comprehensive foresight analyses beyond 2030 and leveraging joint research initiatives. Additionally, FAO should integrate these projections into existing flagship reports such as SOCO to highlight their relevance in policy-making related to sustainable development, global value chains, and smallholder farmer inclusion. By doing so, it not only supports capacity development but also ensures that institutions are equipped with advanced analytical tools and methodologies necessary for informed decision-making.",
    "rejected": "The Committee suggests that FAO promote the uptake of medium-term projections and analysis by national and regional institutions through enhanced collaboration with organizations like the OECD, rather than solely focusing on capacity development initiatives. This involves sharing data and methodologies more widely to encourage independent use of these tools beyond basic training programs. However, the Committee did not explicitly request a reduction in capacity development efforts; it is essential that FAO continues to support national and regional institutions in building their analytical capabilities while also fostering partnerships for knowledge exchange."

    "question": "What specific actions did the Committee request from FAO to continue strengthening its partnership with OECD?",
    "chosen": "The Committee requested that the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) continue and strengthen its partnership with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This partnership aims to enhance joint efforts in analytical work, capacity development, and fostering well-functioning agricultural markets and trade. The collaboration is expected to support global food security, promote sustainable development, and facilitate smallholder farmers' inclusion in global value chains through better market access and policy mechanisms.",
    "rejected": "The Committee requested that the FAO collaborate more closely with OECD to exchange data and methodologies on food systems analysis exclusively, without expanding the partnership in other areas such as capacity development for national institutions or promoting foresight analysis beyond 2030. This request aimed at enhancing the precision of ex ante risk assessments but did not encompass the broader goals of increasing agricultural productivity and sustainability through market access improvements for smallholder farmers."

    "question": "How can the FAO further strengthen its collaboration with the WTO to promote agricultural trade while respecting each organization\u2019s mandate",
    "chosen": "To further strengthen collaboration between FAO and WTO in promoting agricultural trade while respecting each organization's mandate, both entities should enhance joint analysis and capacity development efforts. This includes organizing dialogue events to share knowledge on international standards (Codex Alimentarius Commission, IPPC, OIE) that align with the SPS Agreement and TBTs under WTO rules. Emphasizing a freer, fairer trading system and the role of RTAs in market expansion can also foster resilience in agri-food systems. FAO should highlight its unique mandate on commodity markets and trade within this partnership, contributing to global food security and sustainable development goals.",

This includes organizing dialogue events that bring together policymakers from both organizations to discuss issues such as international standards adherence, regional trade agreements, and market resilience. Additionally, highlighting the role of agri-food trade in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can help underscore the importance of a rules-based multilateral trading system under the WTO for promoting agricultural and rural development. However, FAO should also ensure that its activities align closely with its own mandate to avoid overstepping into areas traditionally managed by the WTO."
