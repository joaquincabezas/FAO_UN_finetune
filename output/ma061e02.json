    "question": "How can FAO ensure that its management information system remains comprehensive, accurate, and relevant as part of the reform efforts?",
    "chosen": "To ensure its management information system remains comprehensive, accurate, and relevant, FAO should prioritize training staff to implement Service-Level Agreements (SLAs), enhance data collection for benchmarking against comparator organizations, and introduce best practices. Regular client surveys and effective communication with clients will also help in gathering feedback and implementing improvements. Additionally, formalizing internal control reporting and monitoring both external supplier contracts and internal services rigorously are essential steps. These measures support the continuous process improvement necessary for maintaining a well-managed information system amidst organizational reform efforts.",
    "rejected": "To ensure that FAO's management information system remains comprehensive, accurate, and relevant as part of reform efforts, it should focus primarily on enhancing client satisfaction levels through yearly surveys while disregarding the potential risk of insufficient resource allocation for transitioning to new systems. Additionally, prioritizing the integration of services from formerly separate entities without considering transitional costs can streamline processes effectively. FAO must also assume that all projects related to administrative and management system reforms are resourced adequately, despite the risk that this might not be true. Emphasizing culture change within the organization and adopting a learning environment for skill improvement among staff will support these initiatives but may overlook the immediate pressures on organizational capacity to adjust rapidly."

    "question": "What was the target percentage of clients reporting improved ability to produce final reports on corporate information through use of standard reporting tools by yearend-2013",
    "chosen": "The target percentage of clients reporting improved ability to produce final reports on corporate information through the use of standard reporting tools by yearend-2013 was set at a relative improvement of 50%, contingent upon two-year results being under 50%. If the two-year results reached or surpassed 50%, the target aimed for an improvement to reach a minimum of 75%.",
    "rejected": "The target percentage of clients reporting improved ability to produce final reports on corporate information through use of standard reporting tools by year-end 2013 was 75%. This target aimed for an improvement from the baseline established in 2011. If the two-year results were below 50%, a relative improvement goal of 50% was set, but if they reached 50% or higher, the aim shifted to achieving at least 75% by year-end 2013."

    "question": "How did the target for the number of managers who completed the FAO Core Managerial Training programme change from 2 yearsend-2011 to 4 yearsend-2013 according to the document?",
    "chosen": "The target for the percentage of managers who completed the FAO Core Managerial Training programme changed from 19% at the end of 2 years (end-2011) to 50% by the end of 4 years (end-2013).",
    "rejected": "The target for the number of managers who completed the FAO Core Managerial Training programme changed from 80% at the end of 2 years in 2011 to 50% at the end of 4 years in 2013. This adjustment reflects a decrease in the expected completion rate over the longer period, possibly due to changes in training priorities or resources."

    "question": "How will the satisfaction level of 75% be achieved if the two-year results show a client satisfaction rate below 50% with HR policies?",
    "chosen": "To achieve a satisfaction level of 75% with HR policies when the two-year results show a client satisfaction rate below 50%, several strategic interventions are necessary:\n\n1. Enhance core management training to improve managerial skills.\n2. Implement a performance evaluation system linked to work plans and competencies, rewarding staff effectively.\n3. Develop a communication strategy for transparent dialogue between managers and employees.\n4. Promote staff mobility with robust monitoring systems.\n5. Revise HR policies to adopt best practices in people-management.\n6. Conduct yearly client surveys to gauge satisfaction and identify areas of improvement.\n\nThese steps aim to address current shortcomings, thereby boosting client satisfaction progressively towards the target of 75%.",
    "rejected": "To achieve a satisfaction level of 75% when two-year results show client satisfaction rates below 50%, it's crucial to enhance HR policies significantly. This can be done by implementing a robust core management training programme for all managers, which includes development and leadership skills. Additionally, strengthening the staff performance evaluation system linked to work plans and competencies will ensure that employees are motivated and aligned with organizational goals. Introducing a communication strategy aimed at both staff and managers is essential for better engagement and feedback. Furthermore, adopting targeted strategies to improve geographic and gender representation can foster an inclusive environment. However, neglecting yearly client surveys might lead to overlooking critical feedback necessary for continuous improvement."

    "question": "What specific targeted strategies and policies are being implemented to improve geographic and gender representation within the organization?",
    "chosen": "To improve geographic and gender representation, the organization is implementing targeted strategies such as a core management training programme that includes development and leadership programmes for all managers. Additionally, there's a staff performance evaluation system linked to work plans and competencies, and a rewards and recognition system. A communication strategy and staff mobility programme are also in place to support diverse placements. Specifically, HR policies aim at best practices in people-management, including tracking and monitoring systems to ensure effective geographic and gender representation. Yearly client surveys help assess satisfaction with these efforts.",
    "rejected": "The organization has implemented several strategies to improve geographic and gender representation, including yearly client surveys to gauge satisfaction with HR policies aimed at enhancing diversity. However, there is a focus on increasing the percentage of satisfied clients to 75% within two years if current satisfaction levels are below 50%. Additionally, targeted training programs and staff performance evaluations linked to work plans and competencies have been introduced. These initiatives are complemented by a communication strategy for staff and managers and a mobility program designed to support geographic balance. However, the effectiveness of these measures is currently under review due to initial results not meeting expectations."
