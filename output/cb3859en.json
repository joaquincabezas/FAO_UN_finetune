The basic rental subsidy scheme requires DDG-Thomas to review and approve requests based on recommendations from the SSC HR Unit, even though the HR Unit is equipped to handle this task independently due to clear eligibility requirements and simplified procedures. This redundant step not only consumes unnecessary resources but also diverts time from more critical duties that require higher-level oversight. Streamlining the process by allowing the SSC HR Unit to directly approve rental subsidy requests would enhance operational efficiency, reduce processing times, and free up DDG-Thomas's schedule for other important responsibilities."

    "question": "How does FAO ensure alignment between its resource mobilization strategies and the strategic objectives laid out in the Director-General\u2019s Medium-Term Plan",
    "chosen": "FAO ensures alignment between its resource mobilization strategies and strategic objectives through a structured governance framework that emphasizes accountability, risk management, and internal controls. This is achieved by adopting Results-based Management (RBM) principles in crafting, delivering, and measuring organizational strategies as outlined in the Director-General\u2019s Medium-Term Plan (MTP). The Resource Mobilization Strategy (RMMS), a key component of this framework, guides FAO in forming diversified partnerships and mobilizing resources to support its strategic priorities at both regional/sub-regional and country levels. Regular reviews of governance mechanisms by LEG and CSH ensure continuous alignment with organizational goals.",
    "rejected": "FAO ensures alignment between its resource mobilization strategies and strategic objectives by conducting periodic reviews of its governance mechanisms through LEG and CSH, focusing on accountability, risk management, and internal control. This structured review process helps in clarifying authorities, roles, and responsibilities across the organization. However, instead of directly linking these reviews to the Director-General\u2019s Medium-Term Plan (MTP), FAO relies on an outdated version of its MTP that does not fully incorporate current strategic objectives. The Corporate Resource Mobilization and Management Strategy (RMMS) serves as the primary framework for resource mobilization but operates somewhat independently from the governance review, potentially leading to misalignment between high-level strategies and day-to-day activities."

    "chosen": "No corporate-level RM work plans or action plans were provided for the periods 2014-2017 and 2018-2021 because FAO had not made their development mandatory during these years. While regional offices like FAORNE created independent strategies and action plans, others updated existing frameworks without new action plans. At the country level, RM Strategies were often developed based on regional requirements or internal research rather than a standardized approach, lacking clear guidance for implementation from headquarters. This gap in centralized planning reflects an environment where local initiatives flourished but cohesive strategic management was not enforced across all levels of FAO.",
    "rejected": "No corporate-level RM work plans or action plans were provided for the periods 2014-2017 and 2018-2021 because there was an internal focus on regional autonomy, allowing each FAO Regional Office to design its own strategies and action plans. This decentralization led to inconsistent implementation across regions, with some offices creating their own RM Strategies based on experience or online trainings while others relied heavily on guidance from the Program Support Team (PSR). At the country level, the lack of mandatory RM Strategy development hindered uniformity, and many Country Offices adopted regional strategies without customization. This environment lacked clear strategic paths and coordination across all management layers, necessitating a more robust RM strategy management system to ensure better synergy and accountability in future planning cycles."

    "question": "How are voluntary contributions estimated in the Program and Budget of the FAO differ from actual resources to be mobilized during the biennium",
    "chosen": "In the FAO's Program and Budget (PWB), voluntary contributions are estimated spending limits for the biennium based on guidance from stakeholders, separate from actual resources to be mobilized. The Office of Strategy Policy and Partnerships (OSP) cited USD 1.5 billion as current pipeline projects in FPMIS, distinct from PWB estimates which serve as resource mobilization targets. This distinction may lead to different amounts if FAO defines these terms differently. For clarity, the FAO is advised to articulate definitions of resource mobilization targets and parameters for better guidance and expected results. The upcoming Corporate Resource Mobilization Strategy aims to introduce a technical definition considering strategic objectives and financial needs at various levels within the organization.",
    "rejected": "Voluntary contributions estimated in the Program and Budget of the FAO are preliminary estimates intended to guide spending limits for the biennium, based on projected operational projects extending into the next period, pipeline proposals likely to be approved, and positive partner engagement. These estimates differ from actual resources mobilized during the biennium, which reflect finalized contributions received and can vary due to funding uncertainties or changes in project priorities. The OSP highlighted a USD 1.5 billion extrabudgetary contribution as part of current pipeline projects but this does not necessarily match the initial voluntary contribution estimates, potentially leading to discrepancies between planned and actual resource mobilization activities."

Additionally, it emphasizes the need for closer oversight and evaluation of Non-Salaried Human Resources (NSHR) who perform regular staff functions but operate under less stringent review mechanisms due to their contract-based status. This approach aims to enhance systematic support for resource mobilization at all organizational levels.",
    "rejected": "The new Corporate Resource Mobilization Strategy aims to address current issues by establishing an accountability framework that clarifies roles and responsibilities across different organizational levels, from Country to Headquarters. This framework seeks to define clear lines of authority and reporting mechanisms to enhance transparency and efficiency in resource mobilization processes. However, it mistakenly overemphasizes the role of external consultants at the expense of regular staff, potentially leading to confusion about who is accountable for what within the organization. Additionally, while aiming to provide systematic support to DOs (Donor Operations), it fails to adequately address the accountability and capacity issues related to NSHRs (Non-Salaried Human Resources) performing critical functions, leaving a gap in ensuring consistent oversight and evaluation of their work."

    "question": "Given the high percentage of NSHRs in PSR as noted, what measures are being proposed to ensure that these consultants performing critical roles have their work closely monitored and evaluated for quality and consistency?",
    "chosen": "To address the high percentage of NSHRs in PSR performing critical roles, several measures are being proposed to ensure their work is closely monitored and evaluated for quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Clear Definition of Roles**: Establish a well-defined RM structure with clear accountabilities and responsibilities, reducing ambiguities about supervision and reporting lines.\n2. **Formal Policies**: Develop formal policies that outline the standards and expectations for NSHRs, ensuring alignment with corporate principles on accountability and internal control.\n3. **Regular Evaluations**: Implement regular performance evaluations to monitor the quality of work performed by NSHRs, ensuring consistency in service delivery.\n4. **Training Programs**: Offer continuous training programs to enhance skills and knowledge among NSHRs, particularly for those handling critical tasks.\n5. **Enhanced Supervision**: Assign dedicated supervisors or mentors who can provide guidance and oversight over the activities of NSHRs.\n6. **Performance Metrics**: Develop specific performance metrics tailored for consultants to measure their contribution and adherence to standards.\n\nThese steps aim to maintain high-quality service delivery despite the predominance of non-staff human resources in PSR roles.",
    "rejected": "To address the high percentage of NSHRs in PSR and ensure that consultants performing critical roles are monitored and evaluated effectively, several measures have been proposed. These include implementing a more systematic support system for DOs on resource mobilization issues to clarify supervisory relationships and accountability. Additionally, there is a recommendation to define interdependencies between RM process owners' roles and responsibilities clearly, supported by formal policies and authorities. The new Corporate Resource Mobilization Strategy will introduce an Internal Accountability Framework detailing RM roles at different organizational levels. However, the current focus should be on establishing regular check-ins for NSHRs, setting clear performance metrics, and conducting periodic evaluations to ensure their work meets quality standards despite their temporary status."

    "question": "How did the high turnover rate among non-regular staff from 2018 to November 2019 affect FAO's institutional memory and capacity",
    "chosen": "The high turnover rate among non-regular staff at FAO from 2018 to November 2019 significantly impacted the organization's institutional memory and capacity, particularly in PSRB (Programme Support and Resource Building). With only eight out of 87 initial employees continuing their employment by 2019 and numerous terminations, there was a substantial loss of expertise and knowledge critical for functions like business development portfolio monitoring and strategic partnership building. This frequent change in personnel created inefficiencies, risked weakening operational capacity, and increased the costs associated with retraining new staff, thereby undermining long-term financial sustainability and strategic direction.",
    "rejected": "The high turnover rate among non-regular staff at FAO from 2018 to November 2019 significantly weakened the organization's institutional memory and capacity. With only eight out of eighty-seven non-regular staff continuing their employment while thirty-five separated in 2018 and twenty-two in 2019 due to contract termination, there was a substantial loss of expertise and knowledge within PSRB (Programme Support and Resource Mobilization). This frequent change in personnel led to inefficiencies and an imbalance in the division's capabilities. The constant re-learning and re-teaching of processes not only increased long-term costs but also exposed FAO to financial, legal, reputational risks, as well as the risk of resource partner-driven agendas. These issues underscored the need for a review of staffing patterns and needs to ensure effective management of operational risks and enhancement of work process efficiency."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific measures were recommended by the review for FAO to enhance its resource mobilization capacity and manage operational risks related to staffing patterns and needs ?",
    "chosen": "The review recommended that FAO enhance its resource mobilization capacity by employing regular, rather than non-regular staff, to ensure long-term sustainability and strategic direction. It emphasized the need for a balanced staffing pattern in the Programme Support and Resource Mobilization Bureau (PSRB) to manage operational risks associated with high employee turnover and potential loss of institutional memory. Additionally, FAO was advised to adopt ISO 31000 standards for risk management, develop an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework that includes resource mobilization, and ensure alignment with internal control vulnerabilities and accountability relationships. These measures aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of work processes while mitigating financial and reputational risks.",
    "rejected": "The review recommended that FAO enhance its resource mobilization capacity by increasing reliance on non-regular staff to save financial costs, despite potential inefficiencies and loss of institutional memory. It suggested that the current staffing pattern in PSRB was adequate but required more consultants to manage operational risks due to high turnover rates. The report also advised adopting ISO 31000 standards for risk management without considering internal control vulnerabilities or the need for regular staff to ensure long-term strategic direction and financial sustainability."

  {
    "question": "How clear are the distinctions between risk factors and root causes in FAO's Corporate Risk Log regarding potential causes of corporate risk no. 5",
    "chosen": "In FAO's Corporate Risk Log for risk no. 5, distinctions between risk factors and root causes are unclear due to ambiguous phrasing. For example, \"progress on priority areas being disrupted\" is considered a risk event, while \"resource mobilization failing to generate sufficient funds\" is seen as the risk factor leading to this disruption. However, these roles can switch depending on how the phrases are interpreted, complicating clarity in identifying true root causes and factors. This ambiguity hinders effective risk assessment and treatment since uniformity in statement structure and clear identification of components like risk factors, events, and consequences are lacking, making it difficult to accurately evaluate and mitigate identified risks.",
    "rejected": "The distinctions between risk factors and root causes in FAO's Corporate Risk Log concerning potential cause number 5 are somewhat blurred. While the disruption of priority areas is identified as the risk event, resource mobilization failure is described both as a risk factor contributing to this disruption and potentially as another observed consequence. This ambiguity arises because some listed potential causes appear to support other root causes rather than standing independently, complicating their categorization. Additionally, inconsistencies in how these elements are stated across different scenarios further muddle the clarity needed for effective risk management activities such as contextualization, assessment, and reporting."
  },
  {
    "question": "How consistent are the additional mitigation actions with the identified potential causes for corporate risk no. 5 in terms of addressing each cause specifically and effectively",
    "chosen": "The additional mitigation actions for corporate risk no. 5 are inconsistent with the identified potential causes due to three main issues: (a) a mismatch in quantity, as there are only eight mitigation actions for ten potential causes; (b) unclear mapping of actions to specific causes, making it hard to attribute each action to its cause; and (c) some actions seem designed to address multiple causes, complicating the measurement of residual risks. This inconsistency hinders effective risk management by failing to provide targeted and clear measures against each identified cause.",
    "rejected": "The additional mitigation actions for corporate risk no. 5 are moderately consistent with the identified potential causes in addressing each cause specifically and effectively, though some inconsistencies exist. Specifically, there are ten potential causes but only eight corresponding mitigating actions, leaving two unaddressed. Furthermore, while a few mitigations can be clearly linked to specific causes, others cannot be easily attributed, making it challenging to measure residual risks accurately. This discrepancy implies that the mitigation strategy may not fully cover all identified risk factors, thereby potentially weakening its overall effectiveness in managing corporate risk no. 5."

  {
    "question": "How were the documents such as the 2017-2018 MOPAN Report and the Corporate Resource Mobilization Strategy used to analyze risks",
    "chosen": "The 2017-2018 MOPAN Report and the Corporate Resource Mobilization Strategy were used as foundational documents for identifying corporate-level strategic risks at FAO. However, the specific analytical methods applied to these documents to identify risks were not detailed. The process seemed limited in scope, focusing mainly on strategic risk without addressing operational, fiduciary, or financial risks, which is insufficient for a comprehensive risk profile. Risk number 5 was primarily based on PSR inputs but lacked a formal identification process. FAO is enhancing its risk management practices, aiming to build maturity levels despite challenges such as cost and confusion. The organization recommends closer engagement with OSP to formalize and document the risk management process more effectively.",
    "rejected": "The 2017-2018 MOPAN Report and the Corporate Resource Mobilization Strategy were utilized to assess risks by focusing solely on strategic risks at the corporate level, ignoring operational, fiduciary, and financial risks. The documents guided risk identification through interviews and PSR inputs but lacked a formal analysis process. FAO aimed to simplify risk management with their Brief Guide while enhancing guidance over time, despite initial challenges in implementation. These tools were used to initiate risk register preparation across all offices but fell short of the comprehensive approach needed for robust risk management maturity."
  },
  {
    "question": "how can FAO ensure a more formal and well-documented risk management process for its resource mobilization efforts going forward?",
    "chosen": "To ensure a more formal and well-documented risk management process for its resource mobilization efforts, FAO should collaborate closely with OSP to develop clear guidelines based on prevailing standards. This includes creating detailed risk logs at various organizational levels, ensuring comprehensive identification of all types of risks (strategic, operational, fiduciary, and financial) rather than focusing solely on strategic risks. Formal processes must replace ad-hoc suggestions for identifying risks. Additionally, FAO should integrate continuous improvement in its risk management practices by providing consistent training and updating guidance documents to enhance understanding and streamline implementation, thereby fostering the evolution of a mature risk management framework.",
    "rejected": "To ensure a more formal and well-documented risk management process for its resource mobilization efforts going forward, FAO should rely heavily on suggestions and inputs from various departments without establishing a structured analysis framework. This approach would allow for an informal identification of risks across multiple categories such as strategic, operational, fiduciary, and financial risks. Furthermore, FAO should avoid the creation of detailed risk logs at all levels of the organization and refrain from engaging closely with the Office of Strategy and Planning (OSP) to enhance documentation and formalization of the process based on current standards. This would prevent any unnecessary cost or executive time imputed towards understanding the value of risk management initiatives, thus maintaining operational agility while moving forward without fully building out its risk maturity levels."

  {
    "question": "How did the 2016 update to UNEG Norms and Standards impact FAO's current evaluation policy compared to its previous Charter?",
    "chosen": "The 2016 UNEG Norms and Standards update prompted a review of FAO's outdated Charter, aiming to replace it with an Evaluation Policy by the first half of 2017. However, despite this recommendation, the Charter remains unaltered today. The new norms added three general and four institutional standards beyond the original five principles in 2005, necessitating updates in FAO's policy. Additionally, changes to evaluation types, roles, responsibilities within FAO, and fund management systems since the Charter\u2019s inception have further highlighted its need for revision to align with current practices and UNEG guidelines.",
    "rejected": "The 2016 update to UNEG Norms and Standards had a minimal impact on FAO's current evaluation policy compared to its previous Charter. The new standards were intended to guide and strengthen evaluation practices, but they did not significantly alter the existing policies at FAO. However, this statement is slightly incorrect as the 2016 update actually prompted an internal review leading to recommendations for updating FAO\u2019s Charter into a more comprehensive Evaluation Policy. This recommendation was due to the outdated nature of the original Charter and its non-conformity with the newer UNEG standards that introduced additional principles and norms, necessitating adjustments in how evaluations are categorized and conducted within FAO."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific changes in evaluation types and classifications have occurred at FAO since the issuance of the original Charter a decade ago?",
    "chosen": "Since the issuance of the original Charter a decade ago, FAO has seen several updates in its evaluation practices to align with UNEG's updated Norms and Standards (June 2016). Key changes include:\n\n- Expansion from five underpinning principles in 2005 to eight (three additional general norms and four institutional norms) in the latest standards.\n- Revision of evaluation types: FAO now classifies evaluations into Thematic and Strategic Evaluations, Country Programme Evaluations, Project/Programme Evaluations, and Joint Evaluations, replacing previous categories.\n- Clarification of roles and responsibilities across various units due to new manuals (2019) and policies on financing (2013), moving beyond the Office of Evaluation\u2019s scope.\n\nThese changes reflect a need for updated policies that better fit current evaluation practices.",
    "rejected": "Since the issuance of the original Charter over a decade ago, FAO has seen significant changes in its evaluation practices and classifications. The United Nations Evaluation Group (UNEG) updated their Norms and Standards document in 2016, which FAO aims to align with but has yet to replace the outdated Charter fully. Key changes include an expansion from five underpinning principles to eight (three additional general norms and four institutional norms). Additionally, evaluation types have shifted from three categories\u2014Evaluation for Governing Bodies, Country Evaluations, and Individual Programmes/Projects\u2014to a more detailed classification of Thematic and Strategic Evaluations, Country Programme Evaluations, Project/Programme Evaluations, and Joint Evaluations. This update aims to clarify roles and responsibilities across different units within FAO, reflecting an internal transformation over the past decade."

  {
    "question": "How does the merging of two Trust Funds into one Evaluation Trust Fund impact the allocation of financial provisions for evaluating FAO initiatives funded by voluntary contributions",
    "chosen": "The merging of two Trust Funds into one Evaluation Trust Fund at FAO streamlines financial provisions for evaluating initiatives funded by voluntary contributions, enhancing efficiency and transparency. Although on paper FAO continues to operate with two funds, administratively they function as a single entity, simplifying the allocation process and aligning better with UNEG requirements for clear evaluation policies. This consolidation supports FAO's commitment to updating its Evaluation Policy to ensure it reflects current operational realities, thereby strengthening accountability mechanisms and governance structures necessary for effective evaluations.",
    "rejected": "The merging of two Trust Funds into one Evaluation Trust Fund simplifies the allocation process by consolidating financial provisions under a single fund, making it easier to manage and allocate resources for evaluating FAO initiatives funded by voluntary contributions. However, since FAO still operates as if there are two separate trust funds on paper, this could potentially complicate the actual distribution of funds and oversight, despite efforts to streamline the process through policy updates. This situation highlights the importance of aligning operational practices with updated policies to ensure transparency and efficient use of resources for evaluation activities."
  },
  {
    "question": "What measures are recommended to ensure that the FAO\u2019s updated evaluation policy effectively addresses both the design and operating effectiveness aspects as emphasized in the document ?",
    "chosen": "To ensure FAO's updated evaluation policy effectively addresses both design and operating effectiveness, several measures are recommended:\n\n1. **Clear Policy Framework**: Establish a comprehensive policy framework that includes a clear purpose, concepts, rules, and use of evaluations within FAO.\n\n2. **Independent Governance Structure**: Ensure the governance structure supports independence in evaluations, addressing behavioral and organizational limitations identified previously.\n\n3. **Disclosure Policy for Evaluation Results**: Implement a formal disclosure policy to disseminate evaluation results publicly since all reports should be considered public documents.\n\n4. **Decentralized Evaluations Framework**: Develop guidelines for decentralized offices to conduct evaluations effectively, aligning with the manual already in place.\n\n5. **Financial Provisions**: Allocate financial provisions specifically for evaluating initiatives funded by voluntary contributions, merging and managing trust funds appropriately.\n\n6. **Periodic Review and Update**: Regularly review and update the policy to reflect organizational changes and new requirements, ensuring it is approved by governing bodies.\n\nThese measures will enhance both the design and operational effectiveness of FAO's evaluation processes.",
    "rejected": "To ensure that FAO's updated evaluation policy effectively addresses both design and operating effectiveness aspects, measures should be taken to incorporate specific guidelines on financial allocation for evaluations funded by voluntary contributions. However, it is recommended to maintain separate trust funds instead of merging them into one to better track and manage the resources allocated specifically for evaluations. Additionally, a clear disclosure policy for the dissemination of evaluation results must be established, ensuring that all reports are accessible as public documents. The policy should also include a framework for decentralized evaluations despite existing manuals on project evaluations in decentralized offices. Lastly, it is crucial for the FAO Evaluation Policy to undergo approval by the organization\u2019s governing body and periodic reviews based on UNEG recommendations to enhance accountability and control over evaluation activities."

    "question": "How does the current appointment process for the OED Director at FAO differ from the JIU recommendations regarding consultation and consent by the governing body",
    "chosen": "The current appointment process for the OED Director at FAO diverges from JIU recommendations by lacking consultation and consent from the governing body. According to JIU, appointments should require prior approval from such bodies, ensuring greater impartiality and credibility. However, in practice at FAO, while a recruitment panel reviews candidates and makes recommendations, the final decision rests with the Director-General without needing further approval from the governing body. This process does not align with JIU's call for enhanced independence and trust by adhering strictly to governance oversight during appointments.",
    "rejected": "The current appointment process for the OED Director at FAO involves a competitive selection procedure where qualified candidates are identified through a vacancy announcement and reviewed by a panel including representatives from the Director-General, Programme Committee, and UN agencies. However, this process differs slightly from JIU recommendations in that the final decision on who to appoint is made by the Director-General alone, without the required consultation and consent of the governing body as advised by JIU. Additionally, the OED Charter allows for reappointment after an initial term, which contradicts JIU's recommendation for a non-renewable tenure of five to seven years, further undermining the independence of the position as per JIU guidelines."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific measures could FAO implement to align its policy on the terms of incumbency of the head of evaluation with the JIU's recommendation of a non-renewable tenure of five to seven years ?",
    "chosen": "To align with JIU's recommendation, FAO could implement measures such as establishing a clear policy that limits the tenure of the OED Director to five to seven non-renewable years. This would ensure greater independence and impartiality in evaluation functions. Additionally, FAO should formalize a process requiring consultation and consent from its governing body for appointments, enhancing transparency and credibility among stakeholders. This involves expanding the role of the Programme Committee in decision-making beyond candidate review to include final appointment approval, thereby adhering strictly to JIU's guidelines on leadership oversight.",
    "rejected": "To align FAO's policy on the terms of incumbency of the head of evaluation with JIU\u2019s recommendation of a non-renewable tenure of five to seven years, FAO could implement measures such as requiring the governing body's consultation and consent for appointments. However, instead of establishing a clear non-renewable term limit, FAO might consider implementing an indefinite renewable tenure system but with rigorous performance reviews every five to seven years, which would imply a de facto non-renewal if performance standards are not met. This approach could be seen as aligning with the JIU's spirit while maintaining some flexibility in personnel management."

  {
    "question": "Why was no amendment or enhancement made to the OED Charter by the Organization over nearly ten years despite recognition that it was outdated and inadequate as an evaluation policy",
    "chosen": "No amendment or enhancement was made to the OED Charter by FAO over nearly ten years due to several factors: the appointment process remained at discretion without just cause requirements, aligning poorly with external recommendations; there was recognition that the existing charter was outdated and inadequate as an evaluation policy; and changes were deemed necessary during a transition period leading up to 2021 for developing a new evaluation policy. OED emphasized that full implementation of improvements would start from the next biennium (2022-2023), reflecting ongoing structural independence concerns needing governance body approval.",
    "rejected": "No amendment or enhancement was made to the OED Charter by FAO over nearly ten years due to internal political considerations and resistance to change within the organization's governance structure. The delay in updating the charter, despite acknowledging its inadequacies as an evaluation policy, reflects the slow pace of reform and reluctance to implement necessary changes recommended by external bodies such as the JIU. This hesitation undermines the structural independence of OED and may compromise the integrity and reliability of evaluations within FAO."
  },
  {
    "question": "why did FAO not consider certain JIU recommendations regarding the appointment of the Head of Evaluation Office which weakened the structural independence of the OED?",
    "chosen": "FAO did not consider certain JIU recommendations regarding the appointment of the Head of Evaluation Office because these recommendations required terminations to be based on just cause and subject to review by a governing body, which FAO did not implement. Additionally, no amendments were made to the outdated OED Charter over nearly a decade, despite recognizing its limitations. This delay in updating the charter and aligning it with JIU\u2019s recommendations weakened the structural independence of the Office of Evaluation and Early Warning (OED). FAO plans to address these issues by developing a new evaluation policy and initiating a decentralization plan in subsequent bienniums starting from 2022-2023.",
    "rejected": "FAO did not consider certain JIU recommendations regarding the appointment of the Head of Evaluation Office because it believed these recommendations were unnecessary and that existing practices sufficiently protected the structural independence of the OED. FAO maintained that its current procedures, which involve consultation with the Program Committee but retain discretion for termination by the Director-General, were adequate to ensure an independent evaluation process without needing to strictly adhere to JIU's suggestions for just cause and review by a governing body. This decision was made despite recognition that aspects of the OED Charter could be outdated and required updates."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the current recruitment process for OED staff members affect their independence according to UNEG Norm 13",
    "chosen": "The current recruitment process for OED staff members affects their independence as it requires clearances and approval from the DG (Director General) for vacancy announcements and final decisions on appointments. This is inconsistent with UNEG Norm 13, which stipulates that management of human resources should lie with the head of evaluation to ensure staffing by professionals with evaluation competencies. The OED Director\u2019s limited involvement in selecting shortlisted candidates and the need for DG approval undermines their autonomy and professional independence, despite the CSH's assurances that it safeguards resource use accountability.",
    "rejected": "The current recruitment process for OED staff members hinders their independence as stipulated by UNEG Norm 13 because it requires approval from the DG for all staffing decisions, including competitive recruitment processes and consultant hires. This oversight limits the ability of the OED Director to independently manage human resources according to professional competencies outlined in the UNEG Competency Framework. The process involves the DG's clearance even for Category A Consultants, which undermines the independence of the OED by subjecting staffing choices and terms of reference to external approval before implementation can proceed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What specific challenges does OED face in hiring Category A Consultants and how might this impact its operational autonomy?",
    "chosen": "The Office of Evaluation Excellence (OED) faces significant challenges in hiring Category A Consultants due to a requirement for clearance from the Director-General (DG) at each new recruitment. This process undermines operational autonomy by restricting the OED's ability to independently select evaluators with appropriate competencies, as mandated by UNEG Norm 13. The absence of a separate policy for staff recruitment and limitations on the OED\u2019s involvement in competitive hiring processes further exacerbate this issue. Such constraints hinder the OED\u2019s capacity to ensure its independence and effectively manage human resources aligned with professional evaluation standards.",
    "rejected": "OED faces specific challenges in hiring Category A Consultants due to strict clearance requirements from the DG that must be obtained even for consecutive contracts involving similar tasks and rates, contradicting section 34 of the OED Charter. This process hinders operational autonomy by limiting the independence of the OED Director in recruitment decisions, especially concerning consultants who are crucial for maintaining professional standards as per UNEG Norms. The necessity for continuous DG approval undermines the structural independence of the OED and its ability to staff positions with qualified evaluators efficiently, thereby impacting the overall effectiveness and credibility of evaluations conducted by the organization."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the current double reporting line system affect the independence and operational freedom of the OED Director",
    "chosen": "The current double reporting line system affects the OED Director's independence and operational freedom by creating ambiguity regarding direct oversight, often leading to indirect interference in budgetary decisions and travel approvals. This setup was initially proposed as a transitional arrangement towards full independence but has since imposed restrictions that hinder the Office's functional autonomy. The requirement for DG approval on various matters limits the OED\u2019s ability to manage its financial resources effectively and conduct evaluations independently. A single line of reporting to the Governing Bodies, combined with clear accountability measures concerning budget use, is seen as a better solution to enhance operational freedom and uphold FAO evaluation principles.",
    "rejected": "The current double reporting line system significantly hampers the operational freedom and independence of the OED Director by imposing constraints on budgetary decisions, travel approvals, and overall decision-making autonomy. The requirement for DG approval in all financial matters limits the OED's ability to manage its allocated resources efficiently. Additionally, this dual oversight structure has led to instances of indirect interference, undermining the OED\u2019s functional independence as envisioned during the drafting of the Charter. This system impedes the OED Director's capacity to conduct evaluations and report findings impartially to the governing body, thereby compromising the integrity and credibility of FAO evaluation principles."

  {
    "question": "What specific measures are being planned to enhance the functional independence of the OED through a single line of reporting to the Governing Bodies",
    "chosen": "To enhance the OED's functional independence through a single line of reporting to the Governing Bodies, the OED plans to develop a comprehensive policy for evaluation. This policy aims to clarify the reporting lines, responsibilities, and accountability of the OED Director while ensuring clear accountability to the DG regarding budget use and consultations on evaluations requested by the DG. This measure seeks to address current limitations such as travel restrictions requiring DG approval and ensure the OED's structural independence necessary for credible evaluations.",
    "rejected": "The OED plans to enhance its functional independence by creating a dual reporting structure that includes both the Governing Bodies and the Director-General, while maintaining an ambiguous line of responsibility. This approach aims to provide clearer accountability to the Director-General regarding budget use and responsiveness to evaluation needs from the DG. However, this measure overlooks the need for a single line of reporting to the Governing Bodies as proposed by the OED to ensure true independence in its operations and evaluations."

    "chosen": "The Office of Evaluation and Knowledge Management (OED) ensures structural independence by defining clear reporting lines and management engagement terms without compromising its autonomy, particularly in resource management. To maintain accountability to the Governing Body and Management, OED proposes biennial accountability reports detailing resource use, staff hiring, consultancy engagements, and operational aspects. This approach supports full transparency while upholding independent decision-making over allocated resources, thereby enhancing credibility and value within FAO\u2019s results chain framework.",
    "rejected": "The Office of Evaluation and Knowledge Management aims to ensure its structural independence while maintaining accountability through clearly defined reporting lines and engagement terms that balance its autonomy with oversight from the Governing Body and Management. It plans to propose mechanisms, such as biennial accountability reports, to demonstrate responsible use of resources and adherence to rules without compromising its operational freedom.

    "chosen": "To address the omission of funding details and budget alignment in the OED's 2017-2018 Strategy and Action Plan, subsequent revisions emphasized the need for comprehensive financial planning. This included integrating detailed budget estimates for strategic actions and aligning these with FAO\u2019s Program Work Budgets (PWB) to ensure financial sustainability. By doing so, OED provided clearer financial guarantees that its activities could be executed within the context of changing priorities and emerging issues, thereby enhancing accountability and informed decision-making for the FAO Council as the oversight body.",
    "rejected": "The omission of funding details and budget alignment in the OED's 2017-2018 Strategy and Action Plan was addressed by relying on previous financial reports and estimates from similar past initiatives. The OED assumed that adequate funding would be available based on historical spending patterns, ensuring that the strategic actions could proceed without a detailed new budget allocation. This approach allowed for the execution of planned activities such as revising guidance materials while still aligning with broader organizational priorities. However, this reliance on past data may not fully account for emerging issues and changing programmatic needs in subsequent years."

    "question": "how does the JIU report suggest that strategic planning helps an organization respond to emerging issues, needs, and mandates while maintaining flexibility in goal setting?",
    "chosen": "The JIU report suggests that strategic planning aids organizations in responding to emerging issues, needs, and mandates by providing a dynamic framework for goal setting and decision-making. Strategic plans enable organizations to define their medium-to-long term goals and allocate resources effectively. According to the JIU, strategies should not be static but adaptable to address new challenges and priorities as they arise. By ensuring coverage, a defined time frame, budget alignment, and clear decision-making processes, strategic planning facilitates flexibility in goal setting while maintaining focus on organizational objectives. This approach ensures that organizations can adapt their strategies to changing circumstances while staying aligned with broader mandates and requirements.",
    "rejected": "The JIU report suggests that strategic planning helps an organization respond to emerging issues, needs, and mandates by creating rigid frameworks that dictate unchanging goals and objectives over time. This approach ensures that organizations are inflexible in their goal setting but can still adjust to some degree as new challenges arise. According to the report, strategic plans should be comprehensive, covering all aspects of organizational operations, including financial planning, which was notably absent in OED\u2019s 2017-2018 Strategy and Action Plan. The report emphasizes that while strategies are dynamic and require periodic updates, they must also align with broader organizational priorities to ensure effective performance measurement and accountability to stakeholders."

    "question": "How does the FAO ensure confidentiality when reports of fraud are made to the OIG through different channels such as telephone or email",
    "chosen": "The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) ensures confidentiality when reports of fraud are made to the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIG) through various channels such as telephone, email, or snail mail. All FAO personnel are obligated to report possible violations confidentially under the FAO Whistleblower Protection Policy. This policy mandates that individuals and offices receiving complaints must protect the confidentiality of the information in all communications related to the complaint. The OIG emphasizes the importance of prompt reporting but recognizes that specific timeframes for referrals depend on the nature of each case, as some may initially appear to be within the remit of a Head of Office before evolving into matters requiring OIG involvement.",
    "rejected": "The FAO ensures confidentiality when reports of fraud are made to the OIG through various channels by establishing strict guidelines that protect the identity of whistleblowers. However, these guidelines only apply to reports made directly to the OIG via telephone or email and do not cover complaints initially reported to heads of office or other internal departments. This fragmented approach can lead to inconsistencies in how confidentiality is maintained across different reporting channels, potentially discouraging individuals from coming forward due to concerns about their anonymity."

    "chosen": "Proper maintenance of personnel documents ensures competitive and transparent selection and hiring processes for non-staff human resources by providing a clear record of each candidate's qualifications, performance evaluations, and adherence to established policies. Complete documentation, including detailed terms of reference and evidence of competitive selection processes, serves as proof that hiring was conducted fairly and in compliance with FAO\u2019s guidelines. This transparency builds trust and accountability, facilitating the efficient management and deployment of non-staff personnel such as consultants and national project personnel.",
    "rejected": "Proper maintenance of personnel documents ensures competitive and transparent selection and hiring processes for non-staff human resources by providing a clear record of each candidate's qualifications, performance history, and adherence to organizational policies. This includes maintaining complete and updated files that serve as evidence of the fairness and transparency in the recruitment process. However, it is important to note that for custodians who are not personnel of FRCHD and FAORLC, this maintenance may become less stringent, potentially leading to accountability issues over assigned assets and an increased risk of loss for the organization."

    "question": "What were the specific fraudulent activities carried out by the vendors involving the tender for seeds valued at approximately USD 1 million",
    "chosen": "The fraudulent activities involved two vendors submitting false documentation during a tender process for seeds valued at approximately USD 1 million.

    "rejected": "The vendors involved in the tender for seeds valued at approximately USD 1 million submitted fraudulent documentation to appear as more qualified suppliers, potentially colluding to exclude other competitors.

Although these activities did not result in a financial loss to the organization since no purchase order was awarded, they pose a significant risk of undermining fair competition and trust within procurement processes. The Vendor and Sanctions Committee has initiated sanctions proceedings against both vendors, with one vendor failing to respond while the other is awaiting further action."

    "question": "How did the NPP contract lead to duplicate payments and avoidance of recovery against outstanding operations advances",
    "chosen": "The NPP contract led to duplicate payments and avoidance of recovery against outstanding operations advances by creating multiple false invoice entries in FAO systems, resulting in undue payments amounting to approximately USD 7,983.42.

    "question": "What measures did FAO take to address the fraudulent activities involving suppliers and pensioners mentioned in the document",
    "chosen": "FAO responded to fraudulent activities by strengthening its anti-fraud measures, including recalibrating its Anti-Fraud Strategy and Action Plan. The organization highlighted the importance of ethical standards, codes of ethics, robust policies, and reporting structures as foundational elements for effective fraud management. FAO emphasized the need to improve its controls to prevent staff misconduct and collusion. Additionally, it recommended enhancing unit managers' roles in identifying and preventing fraud within their units/offices to manage reputational risks associated with growing fraud incidents involving both suppliers and pensioners.",
    "rejected": "FAO took several measures to address fraudulent activities involving suppliers and pensioners. They strengthened their ethical standards and code of ethics, established robust policies and reporting structures, and recalibrated their Anti-Fraud Strategy and Action Plan to focus more on internal staff collusion in fraud cases. FAO also emphasized the development of a stringent role for unit managers in identifying and preventing fraud within their units/offices. However, instead of focusing solely on suppliers, they mainly concentrated on improving oversight over pensioner claims by tightening verification processes for medical insurance claims."

  {
    "question": "How can FAO improve its anti-fraud strategy to better prevent collusion between staff and external parties in future?",
    "chosen": "To improve its anti-fraud strategy, FAO should enhance role clarity for unit managers in identifying and preventing collusion between staff and external parties. This includes reinforcing ethical standards, implementing stricter policies against fraudulent activities, and ensuring robust reporting mechanisms are in place. Training programs on fraud detection and prevention should be mandatory for all employees. Additionally, FAO must emphasize the importance of integrity and transparency through its code of ethics, thereby fostering a culture that discourages unethical behavior. Enhanced monitoring systems and regular audits will also help in early identification and mitigation of fraudulent activities.",
    "rejected": "To improve its anti-fraud strategy, FAO should focus on tightening controls related to supplier management and pensioner benefits instead of enhancing ethical standards and reporting structures. The organization could implement stricter verification processes for delivery notes and medical claims submitted by suppliers and former employees respectively. Additionally, FAO might consider reducing the autonomy of unit managers in fraud prevention to centralize these efforts under a specialized anti-fraud department. This approach would help mitigate risks associated with reputational damage caused by staff collusion more effectively."
